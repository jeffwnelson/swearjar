2
00:00:56,686 --> 00:01:00,106
- Remember when they used to let commercial airlines land in this town?
- Yeah.

3
00:01:00,189 --> 00:01:02,442
Well, I don't understand where we're going...

4
00:01:02,525 --> 00:01:04,695
...or why the hell we're bothering anyhow.

5
00:01:04,862 --> 00:01:07,906
- You're doing a good deed.
- Wanna give us a better reason?

6
00:01:08,023 --> 00:01:12,161
Yeah. A maniac hijacked a municipal bus with 30
passengers on it. That's a very good reason.

7
00:01:12,619 --> 00:01:16,124
And I got a real bad hunch where those passengers are
and who that maniac is.

8
00:01:16,207 --> 00:01:17,625
You wanna share it with us?

9
00:01:18,251 --> 00:01:19,294
Phoenix.

10
00:01:19,878 --> 00:01:21,129
Simon Phoenix.

11
00:01:58,377 --> 00:02:00,421
Send a maniac to catch one.

12
00:02:02,457 --> 00:02:05,658
Phoenix!

13
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,172
Don't move, Phoenix.

14
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:23,303
You're under arrest.

15
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:25,513
Arrest? Shit.

16
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:28,016
And you're trespassing.

17
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:30,769
Where are the passengers?

18
00:03:30,853 --> 00:03:32,897
Oh, yes, passengers.

19
00:03:33,063 --> 00:03:34,607
Well, they're....

20
00:03:35,691 --> 00:03:36,942
Fuck you.

21
00:03:37,026 --> 00:03:38,903
The passengers are gone.

22
00:03:39,361 --> 00:03:42,865
See, I told the city, I said
"Look, nobody comes down here."

23
00:03:43,492 --> 00:03:45,202
Postmen figured it out...

24
00:03:45,368 --> 00:03:46,953
...policemen figured it out.

25
00:03:47,037 --> 00:03:50,332
But the goddamn bus drivers
just wouldn't listen.

26
00:03:50,957 --> 00:03:52,751
Last time, Phoenix.

27
00:03:53,126 --> 00:03:55,128
Where are the hostages?

28
00:03:55,253 --> 00:03:58,508
To hell with the hostages!
This is between you and me!

29
00:04:03,387 --> 00:04:04,472
What you got, soldier boy?

30
00:04:04,555 --> 00:04:05,640
Do something.

31
00:04:05,723 --> 00:04:07,016
Go ahead.

32
00:04:07,976 --> 00:04:10,145
You're up to your ass in gasoline.

33
00:04:13,524 --> 00:04:15,400
I'll set your ass on fire.

34
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:30,125
Is it cold in here...

35
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:32,418
...or is it just me?

36
00:05:04,662 --> 00:05:06,122
Where are they, Phoenix?

37
00:05:06,205 --> 00:05:07,957
Now, where did I put them?

38
00:05:08,249 --> 00:05:11,503
I swear, I'd lose my head
if it wasn't attached.

39
00:05:12,838 --> 00:05:14,840
I'll keep that in mind.

40
00:05:56,384 --> 00:05:59,555
Damn it, John. I'm tired
of this "Demolition-Man" shit!

41
00:06:00,014 --> 00:06:02,266
You were not supposed
to come down here!

42
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:05,937
You were not supposed to attempt
the arrest of Phoenix single-handed...

43
00:06:05,987 --> 00:06:07,688
...and you were not supposed to blow anything up!

44
00:06:07,772 --> 00:06:10,942
It's not me, this time, Healy. He dumped the gas
and rigged the place to blow!

45
00:06:11,025 --> 00:06:12,694
Yeah right, you had nothing to do with it.

46
00:06:12,778 --> 00:06:15,405
I know you've been trying
to nail this psycho for 2 years.

47
00:06:15,489 --> 00:06:17,449
But try remembering a little thing called...

48
00:06:17,616 --> 00:06:19,368
...official police procedure.

49
00:06:19,451 --> 00:06:21,411
- Where are the hostages?
- They're not here.

50
00:06:21,495 --> 00:06:22,204
What do you mean they are not here?

51
00:06:22,287 --> 00:06:24,207
He must've stashed them someplace else!

52
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:26,167
How do you know they weren't in there? Are you sure?

53
00:06:26,251 --> 00:06:29,796
Because I did a thermo check and there
was only eight of them, all part of his gang.

54
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:31,047
Wrong again!

55
00:06:31,214 --> 00:06:32,966
You got something to say, scumbag?

56
00:06:33,883 --> 00:06:35,426
Get him out of here!

57
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:37,263
Motherfucker!

58
00:06:37,346 --> 00:06:39,598
You and I gonna have a nice long chat.

59
00:06:40,474 --> 00:06:41,475
Captain!

60
00:06:42,476 --> 00:06:44,937
Over here! There's bodies everywhere!

61
00:06:45,062 --> 00:06:46,605
There must be 20 or 30.

62
00:06:46,689 --> 00:06:48,191
They're everywhere.

63
00:06:49,568 --> 00:06:50,986
See that, Captain? I told him!

64
00:06:51,069 --> 00:06:52,904
He said he didn't care!

65
00:06:53,196 --> 00:06:56,950
How could you sacrifice
all those innocent people for me!

66
00:06:57,701 --> 00:06:59,494
What kind of man are you?

67
00:06:59,578 --> 00:07:02,915
We're gonna spend a lot of quality time together.
See you, sweetie!

68
00:07:02,999 --> 00:07:04,542
Honey! Sugar!

69
00:07:05,585 --> 00:07:07,920
If you got a lawyer, you better call him.

70
00:08:04,273 --> 00:08:07,860
John Spartan, you've done great deeds
for the city of Los Angeles.

71
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:11,572
So, it is with some regret that, I,
William Smithers...

72
00:08:11,697 --> 00:08:15,244
...acting as Assistant Warden,
hereby carry out this sentence.

73
00:08:15,494 --> 00:08:16,787
Skip it.

74
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,998
Sargeant Spartan, you've been sentenced to 70 years...

75
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:24,336
...sub-zero re-habilitation
in the California Cryo-Penitentiary...

76
00:08:24,628 --> 00:08:28,007
...for the involuntary manslaughter
of 30 innocent civilians.

77
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:29,551
Skip it.

78
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:33,096
You'll be placed in cryo-stasis
for the duration of your sentence...

79
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:36,724
...during which your behavior will be altered
through synaptic suggestion.

80
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:40,271
You'll be eligible for parole
no earlier than the year 2046.

81
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:50,322
I'm sorry, Sargeant.

82
00:11:53,145 --> 00:11:54,480
"All personnel..."

83
00:11:54,563 --> 00:11:58,193

00:11:58,318 --> 00:12:00,362

"Warden William Smithers
report to Level A, conference room"

86
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:13,251
Mellow greetings, Warden William Smithers.

87
00:12:13,918 --> 00:12:16,462
Be well, Lieutenant Lenina Huxley.

88
00:12:17,338 --> 00:12:19,173
As it is a beautiful...

89
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:23,053
...Monday morning and as my duty log
irrationally requires it...

90
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:25,889
...I'm hereby querying you
on the prison population update.

91
00:12:25,973 --> 00:12:27,724
Does the tedium continue?

92
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:30,561
Your earnest questioning is as amusing as it is irrelevant.

93
00:12:30,686 --> 00:12:33,355
The prisoners are ice cubes.
They never move.

94
00:12:34,065 --> 00:12:37,152
I find this lack of stimulus
to be truly disappointing.

95
00:12:37,235 --> 00:12:38,987
- Don't you think?
- I try not to.

96
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:41,406
However, you're young, think all you want.

97
00:12:41,573 --> 00:12:44,617
Things don't happen anymore,
we've taken care of all that.

98
00:12:44,701 --> 00:12:47,538
I'll fiber-op you back
after the parole hearings.

99
00:12:47,621 --> 00:12:49,206
Have a peachy day, Lieutenant.

100
00:12:49,373 --> 00:12:50,416
Be well.

101
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:51,458
Be well.

00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:06,224
Go on.

107
00:13:14,317 --> 00:13:15,401
Self-drive on.

00:13:15,485 --> 00:13:17,278

00:13:17,653 --> 00:13:19,030

That's it.

114
00:14:03,245 --> 00:14:05,080
Food, glorious food.

115
00:14:05,789 --> 00:14:07,207
There'll be another one in about 12 hours.

116
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:09,668
These assholes are nothing if not predictable.

117
00:14:10,043 --> 00:14:11,586
God, I love to hate this place!

118
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:13,339
There's not enough of us, Friendly.

119
00:14:13,422 --> 00:14:15,424
That doesn't really matter anymore, does it Crow?

120
00:14:15,508 --> 00:14:16,884
People are hungry.

121
00:14:16,968 --> 00:14:18,886
We've got nothing left to lose.

122
00:14:32,734 --> 00:14:34,069
Greetings, Merwin.

123
00:14:34,236 --> 00:14:35,779
Lovely Lenina.

124
00:14:37,699 --> 00:14:41,202
Greetings and salutations. Welcome
to the emergency line of the SAPD.

125
00:14:42,078 --> 00:14:45,081
If you prefer an automated response,
press 1 now.

126
00:14:45,248 --> 00:14:46,541
Be well.

127
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,922
Mellow greetings, Lenina Huxley.

128
00:14:52,006 --> 00:14:54,008
Let me guess, all is serene?

129
00:14:54,216 --> 00:14:57,011
On the contrary, it's been a horrific a.m.

130
00:14:57,428 --> 00:14:59,597
There was a defacement of public buildings.

131
00:14:59,763 --> 00:15:01,641
Walls smudged with...

132
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,768
...scandalous graffiti.

133
00:15:03,852 --> 00:15:04,936
Really?

134
00:15:05,103 --> 00:15:08,064
Brutal. Why wasn't there
an "all-cars notify"?

135
00:15:08,273 --> 00:15:11,776
Because there was no need
to create widespread panic.

136
00:15:12,861 --> 00:15:14,614
Lieutenant Huxley...

137
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:17,783
...I monitored your disheartening
and distressing comments...

138
00:15:17,867 --> 00:15:19,785
...to the warden this morning.

139
00:15:19,869 --> 00:15:22,872
Do you really long for chaos
and disharmony?

140
00:15:23,748 --> 00:15:27,503
Your fascination with the vulgar 20th century
seems to be affecting your better judgment.

141
00:15:28,462 --> 00:15:32,382
You realize you're setting a bad example
for other officers and sworn personnel.

142
00:15:32,466 --> 00:15:35,135
Thank you for the attitude re-adjustment, Chief Earle.

143
00:15:35,302 --> 00:15:37,012
Info assimilated.

144
00:15:44,812 --> 00:15:46,481
Sanctimonious asshole.

"Lenina Huxley, you are fined one half credit..."

146
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:52,488
"...for a 'sotto voce' violation
of the verbal-morality statute"

147
00:15:52,571 --> 00:15:53,948
Thank you.

148
00:16:00,996 --> 00:16:02,331
That was tense.

149
00:16:02,665 --> 00:16:04,251
- That was tense?
- Yes.

150
00:16:05,236 --> 00:16:10,674
Tell me something, Garcia? Don't you get bored
code tracing perps who break curfew and tell dirty jokes?

151
00:16:10,732 --> 00:16:13,218
Actually, no. I find my job deeply fulfilling.

152
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:17,682
I just can not get over the reality
of this office, Lenina Huxley.

153
00:16:18,182 --> 00:16:20,643
You're still addicted to the 20th century.

154
00:16:20,726 --> 00:16:24,021
High from its harshness.
Buzzed by its brutality.

155
00:16:24,438 --> 00:16:25,898
Holy smokes!

156
00:16:26,524 --> 00:16:30,779
Is there anything in this office which
doesn't violate Contraband Ordinance 22?

157
00:16:30,863 --> 00:16:32,197
Only you, Alfredo Garcia.

158
00:16:33,824 --> 00:16:36,326
Don't you ever want something to happen?

159
00:16:37,536 --> 00:16:38,829
Goodness, no.

160
00:16:39,621 --> 00:16:41,374
I knew you were gonna say that.

161
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:46,379

00:26:32,471 --> 00:26:33,598
"...activated"

324
00:26:33,681 --> 00:26:34,682
"Aborted"

325
00:26:34,765 --> 00:26:36,809
"Human presence detected"

326
00:26:37,393 --> 00:26:39,729
"Safety override code accepted"

327
00:26:40,146 --> 00:26:41,731
Lucky number seven.

328
00:26:58,875 --> 00:27:00,251
We're police officers!

329
00:27:00,335 --> 00:27:03,254
We're not trained to handle this kind
of violence!

330
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:12,014
Hey, wait for me!

331
00:27:34,455 --> 00:27:35,665
Stupid.

332
00:27:49,429 --> 00:27:51,598
"Simon says: Everybody sing!"

333
00:27:54,101 --> 00:27:55,602
"And the home..."

334
00:27:56,436 --> 00:27:59,680
"...of the brave"

335
00:28:00,066 --> 00:28:01,442
"Play ball!"

336
00:28:09,534 --> 00:28:11,954
We've lost every camera for six blocks.

337
00:28:13,956 --> 00:28:16,417
Go to Century City, 1200 millimeters.

338
00:28:24,551 --> 00:28:27,137
He's going for the vehicle's battery coil.

339
00:28:27,762 --> 00:28:29,556
It's pure capacitance gel.

340
00:28:39,775 --> 00:28:42,820
The problem is not the defacement
of public buildings or...

341
00:28:42,904 --> 00:28:46,407
...the noise pollution caused
by the exploding devices.

342
00:28:46,532 --> 00:28:48,160
Allow me to explain.

343
00:28:48,744 --> 00:28:51,788
The real problem lies
in the man whose initials...

344
00:28:52,039 --> 00:28:54,291
...mark the detonating graffiti...

345
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:57,252
...on the streets of our peaceful city.

346
00:28:57,628 --> 00:28:59,588
The man behind the "E.F."...

347
00:29:00,673 --> 00:29:02,383
...Mr. Edgar Friendly.

348
00:29:04,427 --> 00:29:06,930
For a sadly extended period of time...

349
00:29:07,263 --> 00:29:09,015
...we in San Angeles...

350
00:29:09,098 --> 00:29:12,478
...have been plagued by a pack
of subterranean hooligans.

351
00:29:13,979 --> 00:29:16,482
You will come to know them as "scraps".

352
00:29:16,607 --> 00:29:20,361
Men and women who have left the comfort
of our society...

353
00:29:20,611 --> 00:29:22,363
...only to spew hostility...

354
00:29:22,446 --> 00:29:25,450
...at the very bosom
they have relinquished.

355
00:29:25,742 --> 00:29:29,329
There was a time when we used
to look upon these scraps...

356
00:29:29,496 --> 00:29:32,332
...as rather pathetic
and relatively harmless.

357
00:29:33,333 --> 00:29:35,085
Now they have a leader.

358
00:29:35,502 --> 00:29:38,422
Mr. Friendly seems relentless
in his ambition...

359
00:29:38,506 --> 00:29:41,384
...to infect our harmony with his venom.

360
00:29:42,009 --> 00:29:43,761
He must, of course...

361
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:45,346
...be stopped.

362
00:29:46,138 --> 00:29:49,476
This radical terrorist behavior,
led by Mr. Friendly...

363
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:52,437
...must not be allowed
to undermine our safety.

364
00:29:55,148 --> 00:29:56,650
Safety Above All.

365
00:29:57,693 --> 00:30:00,487
I expect your trust,
confidence and certitude.

366
00:30:01,823 --> 00:30:03,032
If you'll excuse me.

367
00:30:06,327 --> 00:30:07,579
Dr. Cocteau...

368
00:30:07,745 --> 00:30:11,541
...a cryo-con has effected self-release
from the penitentiary.

369
00:30:12,041 --> 00:30:16,171
It's quite horrific. MurderDeathKills,
all categories of chaos.

370
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:18,040
Enhance your calm. Enhance your...

371
00:30:22,469 --> 00:30:24,138
"Be well" them for me.

372
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:31,855
Get me Captain George Earle immediately.

373
00:30:34,065 --> 00:30:35,483
It was just....

374
00:30:36,402 --> 00:30:37,753
And he was so....

375
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:42,158
How can a man be so blatantly sadistic?

376
00:30:42,325 --> 00:30:44,076
It was fun for him.

377
00:30:44,577 --> 00:30:48,581
I want you to do everything in your
power to snare this agent of destruction.

378
00:30:48,748 --> 00:30:50,833
"You have my utmost confidence."

379
00:30:52,085 --> 00:30:54,046
It will be done, Dr. Cocteau.

380
00:30:55,589 --> 00:30:56,590
"Be well."

381
00:31:01,428 --> 00:31:03,263
"Utmost confidence"

382
00:31:04,599 --> 00:31:06,517
"Everything in our power"

383
00:31:10,521 --> 00:31:12,023
What else is there?

384
00:31:13,441 --> 00:31:14,901
Zachary Lamb...

385
00:31:15,401 --> 00:31:19,365
...how was the fiendish Simon Phoenix
apprehended back in the 20th?

386
00:31:20,115 --> 00:31:21,992
Twelve-state manhunt.

387
00:31:22,326 --> 00:31:24,328
Satellite surveillance.

388
00:31:24,954 --> 00:31:27,539
A video bite on Unsolved Mysteries.

389
00:31:28,375 --> 00:31:30,210
None of them worked.

390
00:31:30,752 --> 00:31:32,963
In the end, it took just one man.

391
00:31:33,129 --> 00:31:34,422
One cop.

392
00:31:35,382 --> 00:31:36,883
John Spartan.

393
00:31:37,425 --> 00:31:38,510
John Spartan?

394
00:31:38,593 --> 00:31:40,053
That's right.

395
00:31:40,262 --> 00:31:42,765
They called him the "Demolition Man".

396
00:31:43,224 --> 00:31:46,809
"Spartan file 98345, LAPD"

397
00:31:48,104 --> 00:31:51,731
"Spartan file 98761C, LAPD"

398
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:57,406
Are you sure this is real life?

399
00:31:57,573 --> 00:31:58,824
Barely.

400
00:31:59,074 --> 00:32:00,367
Spartan's a legend.

401
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:04,621
I've been doing a historical study.
Over 1,000 arrests over three years.

402
00:32:04,788 --> 00:32:06,833
All authentic criminals.

403
00:32:07,166 --> 00:32:09,460
There was a lot more business back then.

404
00:32:09,544 --> 00:32:12,672
"How can you justify
destroying a $7 million mini mall..."

405
00:32:12,755 --> 00:32:15,592
"...to rescue a girl
whose ransom is only $25,000?"

406
00:32:15,675 --> 00:32:17,093
"Fuck you, lady."

407
00:32:17,428 --> 00:32:18,762
"Good answer."

408
00:32:19,847 --> 00:32:21,932
This is your recommendation?

409
00:32:22,099 --> 00:32:24,351
The Demolition Man's an animal.

410
00:32:24,685 --> 00:32:29,106
He's clearly the man for a job such as this.
You could reinstate him.

411
00:32:29,774 --> 00:32:31,860
He's a muscle-bound grotesque...

412
00:32:32,777 --> 00:32:35,280
...who hasn't worn a shield in 40 years.

413
00:32:35,447 --> 00:32:38,366
Simon Phoenix is an old-fashioned criminal.

414
00:32:38,533 --> 00:32:40,452
We need an old-fashioned cop.

415
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:09,650
"Cryo-fac 312-618 is now ready
for routine maintenance and inspection"

416
00:33:29,171 --> 00:33:30,965
"John Spartan, 5864"

417
00:33:32,175 --> 00:33:34,844
"Pulmonary activity approaching normal"

418
00:33:35,011 --> 00:33:37,514
"Body temperature, 63% and rising"

419
00:33:39,182 --> 00:33:40,850
"Biolink engaged"

420
00:33:41,935 --> 00:33:44,605
"Laser defibrillation sequence started"

421
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:47,858
"Plasma transfer in 15 seconds"

422
00:33:49,777 --> 00:33:52,113
"Plasma transfer, 10 seconds..."

423
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:54,031
"...8 seconds..."

424
00:33:54,615 --> 00:33:55,950
"...6 seconds...."

425
00:33:57,536 --> 00:33:59,621
"Plasma transfer complete"

426
00:34:00,789 --> 00:34:02,291
"MTL complete"

427
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:25,399
Hunting down an escaped cryo-con...

428
00:34:25,733 --> 00:34:27,651
...by releasing another one?

429
00:34:28,152 --> 00:34:29,653
I am unconvinced.

430
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:32,239
This is within the powers of the police charter, sir.

431
00:34:32,323 --> 00:34:36,161
He can be released on limited parole
and reinstated to active duty.

432
00:34:36,328 --> 00:34:38,955
It's not enough to collect the '90s,
you have to bring them back to life.

433
00:34:39,247 --> 00:34:41,750
Dr. Cocteau said everything within our power.

434
00:34:41,833 --> 00:34:43,418
I can't think of a better idea.

435
00:34:43,501 --> 00:34:45,671
That doesn't mean it's a good one.

436
00:34:47,173 --> 00:34:50,843
This man comes from a dissimilar method
of law enforcement.

437
00:34:51,010 --> 00:34:54,263
I'm not sure he's any different
than Simon Phoenix himself.

438
00:34:54,347 --> 00:34:55,473
Detective?

439
00:34:57,935 --> 00:35:00,771
Detective, I am Lieutenant Lenina Huxley.

440
00:35:01,438 --> 00:35:03,148
The year is 2032.

441
00:35:04,191 --> 00:35:06,693
The reason you have been released is--

442
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:08,695
How long have I been under?

443
00:35:10,949 --> 00:35:12,367
Thirty-six years.

444
00:35:15,536 --> 00:35:17,038
I had a wife.

445
00:35:17,497 --> 00:35:19,374
What happened to my wife?

446
00:35:20,792 --> 00:35:24,088
Her light was extinguished
in the Big One of 2010.

447
00:35:29,301 --> 00:35:30,636
She died.

448
00:35:31,637 --> 00:35:33,347
In an earthquake.

449
00:35:33,889 --> 00:35:35,475
The earthquake.

450
00:35:38,061 --> 00:35:39,562
I had a daughter.

451
00:35:41,114 --> 00:35:42,816
I made a promise. What happened to her?

452
00:35:42,899 --> 00:35:43,984
John Spartan.

453
00:35:44,067 --> 00:35:46,236
I am Chief of Police George Earle.

454
00:35:46,319 --> 00:35:48,990
We didn't thaw you out
for a family reunion.

455
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:53,995
Consider it fortunate the lieutenant
even bothered to do a probe on your wife.

456
00:35:54,161 --> 00:35:56,831
This is about you
and the cryo-con Simon Phoenix.

457
00:35:56,914 --> 00:35:57,999
What?

458
00:35:58,416 --> 00:36:02,838
Today Simon Phoenix escaped from
this cryo-facility. We've had 11 MurderDeathKills...

459
00:36:03,005 --> 00:36:04,089
...so far.

460
00:36:05,090 --> 00:36:08,343
You see, we've become a society
of peace-loving...

461
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:11,931
...and understanding and we are,
quite frankly, not equipped...

462
00:36:12,015 --> 00:36:13,683
...to deal with this situation.

463
00:36:13,766 --> 00:36:17,770
There's been no deaths of unnatural causes
in San Angeles for 16 years.

464
00:36:17,937 --> 00:36:19,022
Where?

465
00:36:19,188 --> 00:36:23,484
The Santa Barbara, Los Angeles,
San Diego Metroplex merged in 2011.

466
00:36:23,693 --> 00:36:25,738
You are in the center of what used to be Los Angeles.

467
00:36:27,364 --> 00:36:28,616
That's great.

468
00:36:30,117 --> 00:36:32,620
- You, get me a Marlboro.
- Yes, of course. Right away.

469
00:36:34,538 --> 00:36:35,873
What's a Marlboro?

470
00:36:35,956 --> 00:36:38,126
It's a cigarette. Any cigarette.

471
00:36:39,461 --> 00:36:43,465
Smoking is not good for you. And it's been
deemed that anything not good for you is bad.

472
00:36:44,299 --> 00:36:48,094
Hence, illegal. Alcohol, caffeine,
contact sports, meat--

473
00:36:48,303 --> 00:36:49,722
Are you shitting me?

474
00:36:49,805 --> 00:36:54,268
"John Spartan, you are fined one credit
for violation of the verbal-morality statute"

475
00:36:55,227 --> 00:36:57,146
What the hell is that?

476
00:36:57,313 --> 00:37:00,232
"John Spartan, you are fined one credit...."
- Bad language...

477
00:37:00,399 --> 00:37:03,987
...chocolate, gasoline, uneducational toys
and anything spicy.

478
00:37:04,154 --> 00:37:07,824
Abortion is also illegal, but then again
so is pregnancy if you don't have a license.

479
00:37:07,908 --> 00:37:09,034
Caveman...

480
00:37:09,159 --> 00:37:12,245
...let's finish with the Rip Van Winkle
and get moving.

481
00:37:12,329 --> 00:37:14,832
Our Mr. Phoenix has risen from the ashes.

482
00:37:16,918 --> 00:37:19,254
I tracked that dirtbag for two years...

483
00:37:19,337 --> 00:37:23,258
...and when I finally bring him down
you turn me into an ice cube for my trouble.

484
00:37:23,675 --> 00:37:25,260
Thanks, but no thanks.

485
00:37:25,426 --> 00:37:28,931
The conditions of your parole
are full reinstatement into the SAPD...

486
00:37:29,014 --> 00:37:32,434
...and immediate assignment
to the apprehension of Simon Phoenix.

487
00:37:32,601 --> 00:37:33,602
Or...

488
00:37:35,521 --> 00:37:38,024
...you can go back into cryo-stasis.

489
00:37:38,358 --> 00:37:41,278
Not many people get a second chance,
John Spartan.

490
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,160
Here you go.

491
00:37:50,161 --> 00:37:52,498
Any new inforama on Simon Phoenix?

492
00:37:52,665 --> 00:37:55,084
There is nothing, Lenina Huxley.

493
00:37:55,793 --> 00:37:57,169
Where's your John Spartan?

494
00:37:57,670 --> 00:38:01,257
He went to the bathroom.
I guess he got all thawed out.

495
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:07,723
Sir, I formally convey my presence.

496
00:38:10,183 --> 00:38:11,643
How are you doing?

497
00:38:12,019 --> 00:38:14,688
We're not used
to physical-contact greetings.

498
00:38:15,273 --> 00:38:16,524
Look, I don't know...

499
00:38:16,608 --> 00:38:18,526
...if you guys know it but you're...

500
00:38:19,611 --> 00:38:21,613
...you're out of toilet paper.

501
00:38:23,031 --> 00:38:24,866
Did you say "toilet paper"?

502
00:38:26,868 --> 00:38:29,580
They used handfuls of wadded paper...

503
00:38:29,955 --> 00:38:31,790
...back in the 20th.

504
00:38:34,209 --> 00:38:37,713
I'm happy that you're happy, but the place
where you're supposed to have the toilet paper...

505
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:40,550
...you've got this little shelf with three seashells on it.

506
00:38:41,968 --> 00:38:44,638
He doesn't know how to use the three seashells.

507
00:38:48,975 --> 00:38:50,560
I can see how that'd be confusing.

508
00:38:50,644 --> 00:38:53,230
I don't believe it. Is that you, Spartan?

509
00:38:54,735 --> 00:38:57,035
No. Zach?

510
00:38:58,736 --> 00:39:00,112
Zach Lamb?

511
00:39:01,322 --> 00:39:02,907
What happened to you?

512
00:39:04,158 --> 00:39:05,619
I got older.

513
00:39:06,078 --> 00:39:08,664
My God, I remember when you were...

514
00:39:09,081 --> 00:39:10,374
...a snotnosed rookie pilot.

515
00:39:10,457 --> 00:39:12,417
They finally grounded me.

516
00:39:12,584 --> 00:39:15,087
Shit, you were a damn good flyer.

517
00:39:15,629 --> 00:39:20,093
"You're fined two credits for violation
of the verbal-morality statute"

518
00:39:20,426 --> 00:39:22,220
I'll be right back.

519
00:39:22,553 --> 00:39:24,222
They seem to be friends, yet...

520
00:39:24,305 --> 00:39:26,724
...he speaks to him
in the most profane manner.

521
00:39:26,808 --> 00:39:31,313
If you'd read my study, you'd know
this is how insecure heterosexual males used to bond.

522
00:39:31,647 --> 00:39:33,107
I knew that.

523
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:37,528
Thanks a lot you shit-brained,
fuck-faced, ball-breaking, duck-fucking...

524
00:39:38,821 --> 00:39:41,366
- ...pain in the ass.
"You're fined five credits..."

525
00:39:41,449 --> 00:39:44,202
"...for repeated violations
of the verbal-morality statute"

526
00:39:44,286 --> 00:39:46,121
So much for the seashells.

527
00:39:46,538 --> 00:39:48,623
See you in a few minutes.

528
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:54,630
"Voice check, Lenina Huxley"

529
00:39:54,964 --> 00:39:57,633
Unfortunately Simon Phoenix
was not coded.

530
00:39:57,717 --> 00:40:00,553
While you were sleeping everyone
in the city was installed a code.

531
00:40:00,636 --> 00:40:04,724
It was a brilliant idea by Dr. Cocteau.
An organically bio-engineered microchip...

532
00:40:04,974 --> 00:40:06,226
...is sewn into the skin.

533
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:09,563
Sensors all over the city
can zero in on anyone at any time.

534
00:40:09,646 --> 00:40:13,483
I can't even conceive a visual of what you
police officers did before it was developed.

535
00:40:13,567 --> 00:40:16,695
We worked for a living. This fascist crap
makes me want to puke.

536
00:40:16,862 --> 00:40:19,115
What do you think you're scratching, caveman?

537
00:40:19,741 --> 00:40:22,493
You really think we'd let you go
without control?

538
00:40:22,577 --> 00:40:24,996
Your code was implanted
the second you thawed.

539
00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:27,582
Why didn't you just shove a leash up my ass?

540
00:40:27,915 --> 00:40:29,584
You dirty meat-eater!

541
00:40:30,376 --> 00:40:32,504
No matter how Viking your era was...

542
00:40:32,588 --> 00:40:35,633
...I cannot digest how
you ever wore a badge!

543
00:40:35,758 --> 00:40:38,719
You're going back, John Spartan,
oh yes, you're going back!

544
00:40:38,802 --> 00:40:41,597
Could you two please
dump some hormones?

545
00:40:41,847 --> 00:40:44,017
We need every cortex we can get in this situation.

546
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:46,019
We don't need the Neanderthal.

547
00:40:46,102 --> 00:40:48,939
Our computer has already examined
every feasable scenario...

548
00:40:49,022 --> 00:40:51,566
...resulting from the appearance
of Simon Phoenix.

549
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:55,613
It's determined he'll attempt to set up
a new drug lab and form a crime syndicate.

550
00:40:55,696 --> 00:40:58,365
"That is correct, Chief George Earle"

551
00:40:58,366 --> 00:41:00,368
Look, I hate to interrupt you two lovebirds...

552
00:41:00,493 --> 00:41:02,203
...but that's really fucking stupid.

553
00:41:02,286 --> 00:41:04,580
You think he wants to start a business?

554
00:41:04,664 --> 00:41:06,582
Phoenix is going for a gun.

555
00:41:06,707 --> 00:41:08,210
Plain and simple.

556
00:41:08,794 --> 00:41:10,045
Trust me.

557
00:41:10,379 --> 00:41:11,588
He's going for a gun.

558
00:41:11,672 --> 00:41:14,049
Who cares what this primate thinks?

559
00:41:14,341 --> 00:41:16,134
Resonate some understanding.

560
00:41:16,218 --> 00:41:19,721
The only place a person
can even view a gun in this city...

561
00:41:20,431 --> 00:41:21,975
...is at a museum.

562
00:41:28,356 --> 00:41:31,442
"Welcome to the San Angeles Museum of History"

563
00:41:32,235 --> 00:41:34,530
"Beneath you will see an excavation..."

564
00:41:34,613 --> 00:41:37,616
"...of an actual 20th-century street scene..."

565
00:41:37,908 --> 00:41:41,704
"...in downtown Los Angeles,
preserved since the earthquake of 2010"

566
00:41:43,831 --> 00:41:47,669
"For specific information
on objects featured in the exhibit...."

567
00:41:47,919 --> 00:41:50,463
"Firearms are displayed in the Armory..."

568
00:41:50,672 --> 00:41:52,590
"...located on Level A"

569
00:41:55,051 --> 00:41:57,805
"You are now entering the Hall of Violence..."

570
00:41:57,972 --> 00:42:01,684
"...a visual representation
of the primitive behavior prevalent..."

571
00:42:01,851 --> 00:42:04,270
"...during the late 20th century"

572
00:42:04,937 --> 00:42:06,647
Home, sweet home.

573
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:14,865
John Spartan, even if Simon Phoenix
was able to locate the cache of firearms, it would...

574
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:17,159
...it would be impossible for him to remove them.

575
00:42:17,242 --> 00:42:20,954
She's right. They're located
in a maximum-security armory exhibit.

576
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:23,458
It's just a hunch, so trust me on this.

577
00:42:23,708 --> 00:42:25,126
It's a cop thing.

578
00:42:25,293 --> 00:42:26,919
And what am I, a frog?

579
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:30,465
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

580
00:42:30,757 --> 00:42:32,391
- I'll drive.
- I see.

581
00:42:36,597 --> 00:42:39,391
"Resetting all bio-links for new driver"

582
00:42:39,642 --> 00:42:42,019
"Weight, height, peripheral vision set"

00:42:42,394 --> 00:42:44,063
"If you would like..."

584
00:42:44,229 --> 00:42:48,652
"...to commence transportation,
John Spartan, initialize sequence now"

585
00:42:49,110 --> 00:42:50,487
You drive.

586
00:42:55,784 --> 00:42:57,786
"Welcome, Lieutenant Lenina Huxley"

587
00:43:09,131 --> 00:43:12,260
You seem very much alone,
John Spartan, but...

588
00:43:12,427 --> 00:43:14,680
...things aren't all that different.

589
00:43:14,763 --> 00:43:17,182
Perhaps you'd like to hear
an oldies station? Oldies?

590
00:43:17,265 --> 00:43:19,309
"Oh, what a relief it is"

591
00:43:19,601 --> 00:43:21,770
This is the most popular station in town.

592
00:43:21,853 --> 00:43:24,524
Wall-to-wall mini-tunes.
You called them "commercials".

593
00:43:24,607 --> 00:43:26,776
"Here's that classic you've all been waiting for."

"The number one request of the day:
'Armour Hot Dogs' "

595
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:30,580
Yes.

00:43:30,613 --> 00:43:32,615
"Kids eat Armour Hot Dogs..."

597
00:43:32,824 --> 00:43:34,492
Oh, wow. This is my fave!

So sorry. Didn't see you there.

607
00:44:09,196 --> 00:44:10,614
Sweet baby.

608
00:44:13,076 --> 00:44:14,369
Oh, shit.

609
00:44:23,879 --> 00:44:25,882
This is what I'm talking about.

610
00:44:26,082 --> 00:44:27,667
How do I get in here?

611
00:44:27,684 --> 00:44:32,347
Hey, hey, do you got to wait that 15-day waitin' period?
Or can I just, like, take one now?

612
00:44:34,098 --> 00:44:35,600
Motherfucker.

613
00:44:41,523 --> 00:44:42,983
Oh, fuck it.

614
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:44,818
Mellow greetings.

615
00:44:45,194 --> 00:44:47,029
What seems to be your boggle?

616
00:44:47,112 --> 00:44:48,489
My "boggle"?

617
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:55,547
How much do you weigh?

618
00:44:55,847 --> 00:44:57,374
Well, I happen to weigh--

619
00:45:04,757 --> 00:45:07,301
"Please vacate the museum, patrons"

620
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:08,803

Wait a minute, this is the future.

624
00:45:16,645 --> 00:45:18,689
Where are all the phaser guns?

625
00:45:23,944 --> 00:45:25,529
Mellow greetings, sir.

626
00:45:25,612 --> 00:45:27,281
What's your boggle?

627
00:45:33,913 --> 00:45:36,082
"Warning, please exit rapidly"

628
00:45:36,165 --> 00:45:39,712
"The magnetic accelerator gun,

So, what? It needs batteries?

632
00:45:48,804 --> 00:45:51,975
What size? Where the fuck do
you find batteries in the future?

633
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:53,977
Is there a battery store around, motherfucker?

634
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:55,979
Excuse me, museum patron. Can I--

635
00:45:58,315 --> 00:45:59,983
Where's Radio Shack?

636
00:46:06,324 --> 00:46:08,034
Sweet music to my ears.

"...activated, the magnetic accelerator gun
will achieve fusion in 2.6 minutes"

638
00:46:12,997 --> 00:46:17,002
Yeah, well, I was thinking about leaving quickly.
Patience is not one of my virtues.

639
00:46:29,641 --> 00:46:31,017
Did you see that?

640
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:32,101
What?

641
00:46:32,185 --> 00:46:35,480
Never mind. I give up trying
to figure this place out.

642
00:46:36,314 --> 00:46:38,816
Excuse me, Rambo. I need to borrow this.

643
00:46:44,031 --> 00:46:46,158
Access and correlate procedure.

644
00:46:46,325 --> 00:46:48,744
Establish communication with maniac intruder.

645
00:46:48,869 --> 00:46:49,995
Wrong.

646
00:46:50,162 --> 00:46:53,083
- Hey, Luke Skywalker. Use the Force.
- Oh, dear.

647
00:46:53,333 --> 00:46:56,461
- What the hell is this?
- It's a glow-rod. It's what we got.

648
00:46:56,544 --> 00:46:57,754
Does it work?

649
00:47:01,558 --> 00:47:02,909
Guess so.

650
00:47:03,176 --> 00:47:04,970
They have him trapped in Section 8.

651
00:47:05,053 --> 00:47:07,264
I doubt it, Huxley. Make sure that building's clear.

652
00:47:07,348 --> 00:47:08,808
Done. I want a visual, now!

653
00:47:08,891 --> 00:47:12,478
Every corridor of the museum, I want full
sensors routed to me. I want it 90 seconds ago.

654
00:47:15,272 --> 00:47:17,859
You guys wait here. Give me 10 minutes.

655
00:47:19,069 --> 00:47:22,406
"Museum patron,
you are now confined to the Armory"

656
00:47:25,283 --> 00:47:28,620
"Museum patron,
you are now confined to the Armory"

657
00:47:34,585 --> 00:47:37,088
"The Armory exhibit is now sealed"

658
00:47:37,922 --> 00:47:41,843
"All museum patrons still occupying
the facility should remain calm"

659
00:47:43,220 --> 00:47:44,930
"Help is imminent"

660
00:47:48,809 --> 00:47:51,228
This museum is no longer sealed, is it?

661
00:47:52,271 --> 00:47:54,566
What can I say? I'm a blast from the past.

662
00:47:54,649 --> 00:47:56,484
You should've stayed there.

663
00:47:56,735 --> 00:47:59,279
That voice sounds familiar. Who is that?

664
00:48:03,241 --> 00:48:04,951
Bad aim, Blondie.

665
00:48:05,118 --> 00:48:06,619
Spartan? John Spartan?

666
00:48:06,954 --> 00:48:10,416
Oh shit. They let anybody into this century!
What the hell are you doing here?

667
00:48:14,086 --> 00:48:15,546
Simon says: Bleed!

668
00:48:18,341 --> 00:48:19,926
Great. Just great.

669
00:48:20,052 --> 00:48:21,845
You're making it too easy for me, Phoenix.

670
00:48:21,970 --> 00:48:24,139
Come on, you space-age piece of shit!

671
00:48:25,015 --> 00:48:26,433
So, let me get this right.

672
00:48:26,516 --> 00:48:30,970
They defrosted you just so you could lasso
my piddly ass? Damn, you been had!

673
00:48:31,981 --> 00:48:34,776
I been dreaming about killing you for 40 years.

674
00:48:37,445 --> 00:48:38,988
Well, keep dreaming!

675
00:49:38,302 --> 00:49:40,304
"AcMag now re-activated"

676
00:49:40,388 --> 00:49:41,639
About time.

677
00:49:41,723 --> 00:49:42,932
Past is over, John!

678
00:49:43,057 --> 00:49:44,767
Time for something new and improved!

679
00:49:44,851 --> 00:49:46,186
Oh, hell.

680
00:49:50,733 --> 00:49:52,868
Holy Shit! I love this gun! Goddamn!

681
00:49:59,701 --> 00:50:01,578
How you liking the future, John?

682
00:50:13,549 --> 00:50:14,717
Come on!

683
00:50:22,768 --> 00:50:23,644
Oh, I know that must have hurt!

684
00:50:23,727 --> 00:50:25,437
Huh, Soldier Boy?

685
00:50:27,022 --> 00:50:28,106
You're on TV!

686
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:29,274
Shit!

687
00:50:36,658 --> 00:50:37,742
You're dead, Spartan!

688
00:50:37,825 --> 00:50:39,786
Forgot to say: "Simon says"

689
00:50:44,916 --> 00:50:45,958
Oh, shit.

690
00:50:46,042 --> 00:50:47,378
Damn.

691
00:50:50,589 --> 00:50:52,341
It's a brave new world. Sorry, you gotta go!

692
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:53,634
Shit!

693
00:51:23,916 --> 00:51:27,379
Our noble facility has been desecrated
by hooligans.

694
00:51:28,463 --> 00:51:30,966
Someone will pay dearly for this.

695
00:51:34,845 --> 00:51:38,975
Sir, the stress breeder is inside
being demobilized as we speak.

696
00:51:41,060 --> 00:51:44,188
Shit. Being frozen must've thrown
my aim off.

697
00:51:44,772 --> 00:51:47,191
Don't worry. I'll get you with the next shot.

698
00:51:48,986 --> 00:51:50,571
I don't think so.

699
00:51:52,740 --> 00:51:54,908
No kiss-kiss, no bang-bang.

700
00:51:56,368 --> 00:51:58,370
And you were doing so well.

701
00:51:59,371 --> 00:52:01,541
Now, don't you have a job to do?

702
00:52:02,459 --> 00:52:06,087
Isn't there a thought repeating
in that barbaric brain of yours?

703
00:52:06,755 --> 00:52:08,506
The name Friendly.

704
00:52:08,673 --> 00:52:10,467
Mr. Edgar Friendly.

705
00:52:10,967 --> 00:52:13,345
Don't you have someone to kill?

706
00:52:21,062 --> 00:52:23,064
- Yeah, I do.
- Excellent.

707
00:52:24,690 --> 00:52:26,693
Then go and do your job.

708
00:52:29,321 --> 00:52:30,238
Shit.

709
00:52:30,447 --> 00:52:32,199
Saved by the bell.

710
00:52:38,331 --> 00:52:39,499
Shit!

711
00:52:48,716 --> 00:52:49,884
Damn!

712
00:52:52,262 --> 00:52:54,431
You don't know how lucky you are
that maniac didn't whack you.

713
00:52:54,765 --> 00:52:59,061
Well, I must say that "whacking",
whatever it is, sounds most disagreeable.

714
00:52:59,937 --> 00:53:01,772
Well, you scared him away.

715
00:53:01,897 --> 00:53:04,651
I don't know how to thank you.
You saved my life.

716
00:53:04,734 --> 00:53:06,152
No problem.

717
00:53:08,613 --> 00:53:10,740
Not bad for a 74-year-old.

718
00:53:11,491 --> 00:53:14,452
Simon Phoenix knows
he has some competition.

719
00:53:14,661 --> 00:53:16,831
He's finally matched his meat.

720
00:53:16,956 --> 00:53:19,083
You really licked his ass.

721
00:53:20,167 --> 00:53:22,003
That's "met his match"...

722
00:53:22,128 --> 00:53:24,171
...and "kicked his ass".

723
00:53:24,797 --> 00:53:27,383
"Met his match and kicked his ass."

724
00:53:28,343 --> 00:53:29,761
Captain Earle....

725
00:53:30,303 --> 00:53:31,972
Who is this man?

726
00:53:32,514 --> 00:53:36,852
Detective John Spartan, temporarily reinstated
to the San Angeles Police Department...

727
00:53:37,019 --> 00:53:39,856
...to pursue the escaped cryo-con
Simon Phoenix.

728
00:53:41,190 --> 00:53:44,485
You told us to do everything
in our power to capture the madman.

729
00:53:44,694 --> 00:53:46,404
Yes, I did. I did.

730
00:53:46,738 --> 00:53:49,782
Yes, I do recall the exploits
of Mr. John Spartan.

731
00:53:50,825 --> 00:53:53,454
Yes, of course. The Demolition Man.

732
00:53:54,413 --> 00:53:56,165
That's quite all right.

733
00:53:56,248 --> 00:53:58,000
Unexpected. Creative.

734
00:53:59,251 --> 00:54:00,711
But quite all right.

735
00:54:00,794 --> 00:54:02,713
John Spartan, welcome.

736
00:54:03,756 --> 00:54:05,925
In honor of your arrival and your...

737
00:54:06,009 --> 00:54:08,428
...protection of the sanctity of human life...

738
00:54:08,511 --> 00:54:10,221
...namely my own...

739
00:54:10,347 --> 00:54:13,058
...I'd like to invite you to join me
for dinner tonight.

740
00:54:13,141 --> 00:54:14,309
Both of you.

741
00:54:14,392 --> 00:54:15,852
Please, I insist.

742
00:54:16,102 --> 00:54:18,272
I would like you to accompany me...

743
00:54:18,397 --> 00:54:20,066
...to Pizza Hut.

744
00:54:23,402 --> 00:54:25,488
Looking forward to it. Thanks.

745
00:54:31,703 --> 00:54:33,080
"Pizza Hut"?

746
00:54:36,541 --> 00:54:38,418
So let me get this right:

747
00:54:38,543 --> 00:54:42,465
Spacely Sprockets here, who's now
the man in charge, the Mayor-Gov...

748
00:54:42,548 --> 00:54:44,967
...who wants to take me to Pizza Hut...

749
00:54:45,051 --> 00:54:46,761
...though Lord knows I wouldn't mind a pizza...

750
00:54:46,844 --> 00:54:48,721
...is also one of the guys who built the goddamn cryo-prison?

751
00:54:48,805 --> 00:54:51,182
"John Spartan, you are fined...."

752
00:54:51,474 --> 00:54:54,395
Dr. Cocteau is the most important man
in San Angeles.

753
00:54:54,561 --> 00:54:57,272
He practically created our whole way
of life...

754
00:54:57,356 --> 00:54:58,732
...savage.

755
00:54:59,358 --> 00:55:00,651
He can have it.

756
00:55:01,735 --> 00:55:03,195
Now, Phoenix could be anywhere...

757
00:55:03,278 --> 00:55:04,988
...but not being coded can hurt him
and limit his options.

758
00:55:05,072 --> 00:55:07,158
That is correct. Money is outmoded.

759
00:55:07,242 --> 00:55:09,285
All transactions are through codes.

760
00:55:09,369 --> 00:55:12,122
All right, so actually he can't buy food
or a place to stay for the night.

761
00:55:12,205 --> 00:55:14,874
It'd be a waste of time to mug somebody.

762
00:55:15,625 --> 00:55:18,003
Unless he rips off someone's hand,
let's hope he doesn't figure that one out.

763
00:55:18,086 --> 00:55:20,131
But with all officers already patrolling in a citywide crisis net...

764
00:55:20,214 --> 00:55:23,551
...it should be just a matter of tick-tocks before we actually--

765
00:55:23,577 --> 00:55:26,637
More importantly. We already have a backup plan.

766
00:55:27,805 --> 00:55:30,224
We can just wait for another code to go red.

767
00:55:30,683 --> 00:55:33,562
And when Phoenix performs
another MurderDeathKill...

768
00:55:33,729 --> 00:55:36,481
...we'll know exactly where to pounce.

769
00:55:36,982 --> 00:55:37,858
Great plan.

770
00:55:37,941 --> 00:55:39,317
Thank you.

771
00:55:45,241 --> 00:55:48,536
I've been an enthusiast of your escapades
for quite some time now.

772
00:55:48,619 --> 00:55:52,749
I have, in fact, perused some visuals from the
Schwarzenegger Library. That time you took that car ...

773
00:55:53,249 --> 00:55:54,333
Hold it.

774
00:55:55,251 --> 00:55:56,962
"The Schwarzenegger Library"?

775
00:55:57,046 --> 00:55:59,840
Yes, the Schwarzenegger
Presidential Library.

776
00:56:00,090 --> 00:56:01,592
Wasn't he an actor, when you--

777
00:56:01,759 --> 00:56:03,469
Stop! He was President?

778
00:56:04,011 --> 00:56:08,350
Yes. Even though he wasn't born in this country, his popularity
at the time caused the 61st Amendment, which states...

779
00:56:08,641 --> 00:56:10,518
I don't want to know.

780
00:56:12,604 --> 00:56:13,980
President?

781
00:56:23,491 --> 00:56:25,785
What's the hell is this?
No door? No welcome mat?

782
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:29,622
What is this?

783
00:56:32,793 --> 00:56:35,379
How do they expect you to kill somebody down here?

784
00:56:37,631 --> 00:56:41,134
Shit, I love that smell.
Reminds me of biscuits and gravy.

785
00:56:41,468 --> 00:56:43,637
All right. A job is a job.

786
00:56:45,348 --> 00:56:49,644
Edgar Friendly, whoever the fuck you are,
prepare for Simon Phoenix.

787
00:56:51,855 --> 00:56:54,482
So, what's with Cocteau guy anyway?

788
00:56:55,149 --> 00:56:57,945
He says I saved his life,
which I'm not even sure I did.

789
00:56:58,028 --> 00:57:00,989
And my reward is dinner and dancing
at Pizza Hut?

790
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:04,118
I mean, hey, I like a big, fat piece of pizza, but come on....

791
00:57:04,326 --> 00:57:06,412
Your tone is quasi-facetious, but...

792
00:57:06,912 --> 00:57:10,458
...you do not realise, that Pizza Hut was the
only restaurant to survive the Franchise Wars.

793
00:57:10,583 --> 00:57:11,668
So?

794
00:57:12,627 --> 00:57:14,796
So, now all restaurants are Pizza Hut.

795
00:57:16,339 --> 00:57:17,590
No way.

796
00:57:27,226 --> 00:57:29,103
Welcome to Pizza Hut.

797
00:57:29,729 --> 00:57:31,355
Enjoy your meal, sir.

798
00:57:33,065 --> 00:57:35,485
"Valley of the Jolly Green Giant"

799
00:57:38,155 --> 00:57:40,407
"Good things from the garden"

800
00:57:40,657 --> 00:57:42,534
"Garden in the valley"

801
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:45,662
"Valley of the Jolly Green Giant"

802
00:57:48,875 --> 00:57:51,044
Here comes the Neanderthal.

803
00:57:51,627 --> 00:57:54,505
Mr. Spartan over there please,
and Lieutenant....

804
00:57:54,630 --> 00:57:55,757
Thank you.

805
00:57:58,886 --> 00:58:00,554
How are you doing?

806
00:58:03,015 --> 00:58:05,100
Enjoy-joy your meal, sir.

807
00:58:05,934 --> 00:58:07,102
Good thing I'm hungry.

808
00:58:07,186 --> 00:58:11,649
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to ask you
to raise your glasses to the hero of the hour...

809
00:58:12,233 --> 00:58:13,818
...my savior...

810
00:58:13,943 --> 00:58:16,071
...Detective John Spartan.

811
00:58:16,072 --> 00:58:17,372
"John Spartan"

812
00:58:18,365 --> 00:58:19,741
Appreciate it.

813
00:58:22,911 --> 00:58:24,663
Greetings and salutations.

814
00:58:24,914 --> 00:58:26,499
I'm Associate Bob.

815
00:58:26,582 --> 00:58:30,252
We met before, ever so briefly.
I was groveling in fear at the time.

816
00:58:31,420 --> 00:58:33,297
You got the salt over there, Bob?

817
00:58:34,340 --> 00:58:37,344
Salt is not good for you, hence, it is illegal.

818
00:58:37,594 --> 00:58:39,513
So, John Spartan, tell me...

819
00:58:40,347 --> 00:58:43,266
...what do you think of San Angeles, 2032?

820
00:58:44,018 --> 00:58:48,272
Well considering the way things were going when I went in,
I thought the future would be a rotting cesspool.

821
00:58:49,273 --> 00:58:52,443
You weren't here
when the real disturbances began.

822
00:58:52,527 --> 00:58:55,196
Civilization tried to destroy itself.

823
00:58:55,613 --> 00:58:58,616
The city degenerated into a total fear zone.

824
00:58:59,117 --> 00:59:03,539
The citizenry cocooning in their homes, afraid to go out.
People just wanted the madness over.

825
00:59:04,748 --> 00:59:07,584
When I saw the chance
to make things right...

826
00:59:07,751 --> 00:59:09,211
...I seized it.

827
00:59:10,796 --> 00:59:14,718
If I had not, the radiance
of San Angeles would not be here.

828
00:59:15,135 --> 00:59:19,848
Just your rotting cesspool of hate
and suffering. Which would you prefer?

829
00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:23,810
Maybe you can book me a flight out of here
when the sermon's over?

830
00:59:23,977 --> 00:59:25,312
John Spartan...

831
00:59:25,479 --> 00:59:28,733
...for your crimes you would
surely have died...

832
00:59:28,816 --> 00:59:30,234
...in jail before now.

833
00:59:30,317 --> 00:59:34,321
Even you must appreciate
the persuasively tranquil humanity...

834
00:59:34,822 --> 00:59:37,116
...of the cryo-prison system?

835
00:59:37,993 --> 00:59:42,789
I don't want to spoil your dinner, pal, but
my cryo-sentence was no sweet lullaby.

836
00:59:42,956 --> 00:59:45,000
I had feelings and I had thoughts.

837
00:59:45,208 --> 00:59:48,962
How about a 36-year nightmare
about people caught in a burning building?

838
00:59:49,046 --> 00:59:51,090
You were awake? I don't think so.

839
00:59:51,174 --> 00:59:52,592
I do think so.

840
00:59:53,092 --> 00:59:57,013
And my wife beating her fists against a block
of ice that used to be her husband.

841
00:59:57,096 --> 01:00:01,684
Then you were nice enough to wake me up and let me know,
everything that meant something in my life is gone.

842
01:00:02,186 --> 01:00:06,315
It would have been more humane
to stake me down and leave me to the fucking crows.

843
01:00:07,483 --> 01:00:10,611
What would you say
if I called you a brutish fossil...

844
01:00:10,694 --> 01:00:14,156
...symbolic of the decayed era
gratefully forgotten?

845
01:00:15,658 --> 01:00:17,327
I don't know. "Thanks"?

846
01:00:18,036 --> 01:00:20,205
I thought during rehabilitation...

847
01:00:20,372 --> 01:00:24,376
...the prisoners were not conscious.
A person would go insane.

848
01:00:24,501 --> 01:00:26,503
The side-effects of the cryo-process...

849
01:00:26,586 --> 01:00:27,963
...are unavoidable.

850
01:00:28,047 --> 01:00:30,049
You were found guilty of criminal charges.

851
01:00:30,132 --> 01:00:32,218
You owed and still do owe a debt to society.

852
01:00:32,301 --> 01:00:33,552
So, there's nothing I can do.

853
01:00:33,636 --> 01:00:36,430
Yeah, there is. Call for backup.
I'll be across the street.

854
01:00:36,514 --> 01:00:37,973
John Spartan, where... Where are you going?

855
01:00:38,057 --> 01:00:41,978
Bad guys about to do bad things.
It's just one of those hunches again.

856
01:01:02,542 --> 01:01:03,710
Go for the truck!

857
01:01:03,794 --> 01:01:05,504
The food's in the truck!

858
01:01:08,298 --> 01:01:10,342
Grab the big box! Come on, move! Move!

859
01:01:22,188 --> 01:01:25,692
You're gonna regret this the rest of your life.
Both seconds of it.

860
01:01:30,948 --> 01:01:32,116
Good night!

861
01:01:41,918 --> 01:01:43,211
Get him!

862
01:02:00,980 --> 01:02:03,316
What a fucking hero. Come on.

863
01:02:12,868 --> 01:02:14,244
Please, don't.

864
01:02:20,210 --> 01:02:21,503
What the hell?

865
01:02:22,504 --> 01:02:24,172
Such reckless abandonment.

866
01:02:24,255 --> 01:02:26,674
Looks like there is a new shepherd in town.

867
01:02:26,758 --> 01:02:29,052
That's "sheriff." Who were those guys?

868
01:02:29,135 --> 01:02:31,180
They're known as "scraps".

869
01:02:31,514 --> 01:02:34,183
Outcasts and deserters who choose
to live beneath us...

870
01:02:34,266 --> 01:02:36,852
...in sewers and abandoned tunnels.

871
01:02:37,853 --> 01:02:40,940
They're a constant irritation
to our harmony.

872
01:02:41,357 --> 01:02:43,151
They're nothing but thugs and hooligans.

873
01:02:43,527 --> 01:02:47,697
A society of thieves. The last remaining
criminal element in the city.

874
01:02:47,948 --> 01:02:51,326
But plans are in progress
to purge this peril from our day.

875
01:02:51,660 --> 01:02:54,121
You're even better live than on laser disk.

876
01:02:54,204 --> 01:02:57,792
And the joy-joy way you paused to
make a glib witticism before doing battle...

877
01:02:57,959 --> 01:02:59,711
...with that strangely-weaponed Scrap--

878
01:02:59,877 --> 01:03:01,879
Huxley, look! This isn't the Wild West, okay?

879
01:03:01,963 --> 01:03:04,424
The Wild West wasn't even the Wild West.

880
01:03:04,507 --> 01:03:06,342
Hurting people is not a good thing.

881
01:03:06,634 --> 01:03:08,303
Sometimes it is, but not...

882
01:03:08,387 --> 01:03:10,723
...when it's a bunch of people looking for something to eat.

883
01:03:19,189 --> 01:03:21,526
San Angeles time is now 22:15.

884
01:03:22,819 --> 01:03:24,070
Huxley coding off.

885
01:03:24,237 --> 01:03:25,363
Auto-drive.

886
01:03:25,447 --> 01:03:27,240
Auto-drive engaged.

887
01:03:32,747 --> 01:03:34,874
Look, I'm sorry I yelled at you back there.

888
01:03:36,667 --> 01:03:39,003
No need to make a de-hurtful retraction.

889
01:03:39,295 --> 01:03:41,839
I just assimilated too much contraband.

890
01:03:42,131 --> 01:03:46,261
I fleshed you out as some
blow-up-the-bad-guy-with-a happy-grin-he-man type.

891
01:03:46,511 --> 01:03:51,974
But now I realise that you're the
moody-troubled-past-gunslinger-who-will-only-draw-when-he-must type.

892
01:03:52,100 --> 01:03:52,934
Huxley, stop.

893
01:03:53,018 --> 01:03:53,852
What?

894
01:03:53,935 --> 01:03:56,188
I'm not any of that. I just do my job and things get--

895
01:03:56,271 --> 01:03:57,440
Demolished.

896
01:04:04,031 --> 01:04:08,659
You know, I keep been looking around,
and I think about my daughter growing up in a place like this.

897
01:04:08,911 --> 01:04:11,705
and I'm afraid she's gonna think I'm some kind of primitive.

898
01:04:11,872 --> 01:04:14,917
I mean, as much as I want to see her,
I almost don't want to.

899
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,628
Because I don't think I'm gonna fit into the picture very
well.

900
01:04:17,795 --> 01:04:19,213
Not very well at all.

901
01:04:21,591 --> 01:04:24,478
It'd be a minor misuse of police powers, but I...

902
01:04:24,479 --> 01:04:26,079
- ...I could do a search for you.
- No.

903
01:04:31,476 --> 01:04:32,685
Sorry.

904
01:04:36,774 --> 01:04:39,193
Oh, subject change. I got what you wanted.

905
01:04:39,318 --> 01:04:40,486
Oh, great.

906
01:04:44,740 --> 01:04:46,118
What do you need that for?

907
01:04:47,202 --> 01:04:49,413
It's just one of those cop hunches again.

908
01:04:58,881 --> 01:05:00,133
Lights.

909
01:05:00,676 --> 01:05:03,428
Nah, I've changed that.

910
01:05:04,262 --> 01:05:05,680
Illuminate.

911
01:05:07,181 --> 01:05:08,599
Deluminate.

912
01:05:11,895 --> 01:05:13,397
Isn't that nicer?

913
01:05:13,522 --> 01:05:15,190
Go ahead, you try it.

914
01:05:16,608 --> 01:05:18,026
Illuminate.

915
01:05:20,612 --> 01:05:23,241
Raymond, Raymond, we got to talk.

916
01:05:24,033 --> 01:05:25,660
How did you get in?

917
01:05:25,785 --> 01:05:28,163
Wish I knew. I got pass codes.

918
01:05:29,038 --> 01:05:30,623
Routes to secret underground kingdoms.

919
01:05:30,707 --> 01:05:34,294
Complete access
to the industrial data-grid interface.

920
01:05:34,711 --> 01:05:36,881
I don't even know what that shit means.

921
01:05:37,048 --> 01:05:40,051
But I've been meaning to ask you
about it, because I like it!

922
01:05:40,134 --> 01:05:41,635
I like it a lot!

923
01:05:43,554 --> 01:05:45,973
Your skills were given you for a reason.

924
01:05:46,057 --> 01:05:48,477
Not for your personal amusement.

925
01:05:48,769 --> 01:05:53,631
Your job is to kill Mr. Edgar Friendly
and stop a revolution before it precipitates.

926
01:05:53,690 --> 01:05:56,276
That is why you were rehabilitated.

927
01:05:59,321 --> 01:06:02,909
All right. I'm gonna do
your little dastardly deed for you.

928
01:06:03,826 --> 01:06:06,788
But it's gonna be a little bit more difficult than you thought.

929
01:06:06,913 --> 01:06:09,165
And I'm going to need some help.

930
01:06:09,582 --> 01:06:12,753
I'll need about five
or six more "special" men.

931
01:06:14,088 --> 01:06:16,456
And I just so happen to have a list.

932
01:06:16,523 --> 01:06:20,677
You see, I wouldn't want you to defrost any of
those mad dog killer types, you know what I mean?

933
01:06:20,928 --> 01:06:24,599
And none of those motherfuckers
from New York. They're too uptight.

934
01:06:24,682 --> 01:06:27,644
So you're going to be the only mad dog killer type around?

935
01:06:28,706 --> 01:06:30,006
Exactamundo.

936
01:06:32,107 --> 01:06:33,191
Fine.

937
01:06:34,192 --> 01:06:35,568
Take care of it.

938
01:06:36,946 --> 01:06:38,531
Just get it over with.

939
01:06:38,864 --> 01:06:41,242
You're beginning to be more trouble than you're worth.

940
01:06:41,450 --> 01:06:43,702
Oh, Raymond, don't say that.

941
01:06:45,538 --> 01:06:48,082
And what do I get out of all this?

942
01:06:50,544 --> 01:06:52,129
What do you want?

943
01:06:52,712 --> 01:06:53,713
Malibu.

944
01:06:54,631 --> 01:06:58,135
Santa Monica.
Hell, what about all the coastal cities?

945
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:01,556
Well, I'll bear it in mind.

946
01:07:01,723 --> 01:07:04,726
- Good, I'll send you a memo.
- Just do your job!

947
01:07:09,397 --> 01:07:11,816
What is John Spartan doing here?

948
01:07:13,568 --> 01:07:15,738
Did you invite him to this little party of ours?

949
01:07:17,656 --> 01:07:19,742
Look, you finish your business...

950
01:07:19,825 --> 01:07:21,994
...and I'll stuff him back in the freezer.

951
01:07:22,077 --> 01:07:24,329
Think of him as a guarantee.

952
01:07:24,580 --> 01:07:26,039
"A guarantee"?

953
01:07:26,833 --> 01:07:29,169
Well, you don't have much of a guarantee.

954
01:07:29,753 --> 01:07:33,047
I took care of Spartan once,
I'll take care of him again.

955
01:07:36,342 --> 01:07:38,763
Now we need those men defrosted.

956
01:07:43,434 --> 01:07:45,102
So, this where you live, Huxley?

957
01:07:45,269 --> 01:07:46,687
Very not bad.

958
01:07:46,854 --> 01:07:47,980
Thank you.

959
01:07:48,606 --> 01:07:50,608
So, where will I be staying?

960
01:07:50,776 --> 01:07:54,154
Oh, I've procured you a domicile
down the corridor from my own.

961
01:07:57,574 --> 01:08:00,535
Everything is voice coded,
so if you need something, just ask.

962
01:08:00,619 --> 01:08:01,787
Lights.

963
01:08:03,372 --> 01:08:04,832
What do you think?

964
01:08:05,833 --> 01:08:09,545
Clicked off a lot of credits to create
the perfect 20th-century apartment.

965
01:08:09,629 --> 01:08:10,963
It's very....

966
01:08:11,130 --> 01:08:12,215
Isn't it?

967
01:08:15,051 --> 01:08:16,470
John Spartan....

968
01:08:18,089 --> 01:08:21,392
There's, of course, a well-known and documented...

969
01:08:21,558 --> 01:08:24,144
...connection between sex and violence.

970
01:08:24,895 --> 01:08:26,980
Not so much a causal effect...

971
01:08:27,147 --> 01:08:30,235
...but a general state
of neurological arousal.

972
01:08:30,735 --> 01:08:31,945
And...

973
01:08:32,237 --> 01:08:36,032
...after having observed
your behavior this evening and...

974
01:08:36,908 --> 01:08:39,160
...my resultant condition...

975
01:08:42,248 --> 01:08:45,251
...I was wondering
if you'd like to have sex?

976
01:08:50,589 --> 01:08:51,674
With you?

977
01:08:51,675 --> 01:08:52,675
Um-hum!

978
01:08:54,344 --> 01:08:55,262
Here?

979
01:08:56,346 --> 01:08:57,131
Now?

980
01:08:57,132 --> 01:08:58,032
Um-hum!

981
01:09:00,183 --> 01:09:01,101
Oh, yeah.

982
01:09:01,935 --> 01:09:02,894
Great!

983
01:09:05,606 --> 01:09:07,108
I'll be right back.

984
01:09:24,626 --> 01:09:26,003
Love Boat?

985
01:09:45,608 --> 01:09:46,859
There you go.

986
01:09:52,448 --> 01:09:55,577
Now, just relax.
We'll begin in a few seconds.

987
01:09:56,787 --> 01:09:58,121
Begin what?

988
01:09:58,789 --> 01:10:00,707
Having sex, of course.

989
01:10:59,521 --> 01:11:00,981
What's wrong? You broke contact.

990
01:11:01,148 --> 01:11:03,608
"Contact"? I didn't even touch you yet.

991
01:11:03,692 --> 01:11:05,861
But I thought you wanted to make love.

992
01:11:06,194 --> 01:11:07,779
Is that what you call this?

993
01:11:10,158 --> 01:11:14,787
Vir-sex has been proved to produce higher orders of
alpha waves during digitised transference of sexual energies.

994
01:11:14,996 --> 01:11:17,540
All right Huxley, what do you say we do it the old-fashioned way?

995
01:11:18,041 --> 01:11:19,876
Ugh, disgusting!

996
01:11:20,042 --> 01:11:21,211
You mean...

997
01:11:21,771 --> 01:11:26,900
- ...fluid transfer?
- No, I mean boning, the wild mambo, the hunka chunka.

998
01:11:27,106 --> 01:11:29,386
That is no longer done.

999
01:11:29,720 --> 01:11:32,332
The exchange of bodily fluids,
do you know what that leads to?

1000
01:11:32,357 --> 01:11:35,435
Yes, I do. Kids, smoking, desire to raid the fridge.

1001
01:11:35,518 --> 01:11:40,231
The rampant exchange of bodily fluids was one
of the major reasons  for the downfall of society.

1002
01:11:40,690 --> 01:11:43,818
After AIDS, there was NRS,
after NRS there was UBT.

1003
01:11:44,402 --> 01:11:47,531
One of the first things that Dr. Cocteau
was able to do was to outlaw...

1004
01:11:47,698 --> 01:11:51,702
...and behaviorally engineer all fluid transfer
out of socially acceptable behavior.

1005
01:11:51,911 --> 01:11:54,580
Not even, not even a mouth transfer's condoned.

1006
01:11:54,747 --> 01:11:55,565
Kissing's not allowed?

1007
01:11:55,566 --> 01:11:56,166
Ah.

1008
01:11:56,248 --> 01:11:57,751
Damn, I was a good kisser.

1009
01:11:57,752 --> 01:11:58,752
Ughh!

1010
01:11:59,544 --> 01:12:00,879
All right, what about kids?

1011
01:12:01,421 --> 01:12:02,881
- Procreation?
- Yeah.

1012
01:12:03,215 --> 01:12:04,716
We go to a lab.

1013
01:12:04,925 --> 01:12:07,010
Fluids are purified, screened...

1014
01:12:07,094 --> 01:12:10,389
...and transferred by authorized
medical personnel only.

1015
01:12:10,556 --> 01:12:12,433
It is the only legal way.

1016
01:12:15,895 --> 01:12:17,355
What're you doing?

1017
01:12:18,064 --> 01:12:19,482
Breaking the law.

1018
01:12:21,275 --> 01:12:23,403
You are a savage creature, John Spartan.

1019
01:12:23,904 --> 01:12:26,448
And I wish you to leave my domicile, now!

1020
01:12:32,955 --> 01:12:34,289
Look, in....

1021
01:12:54,770 --> 01:12:57,398
"Code accepted. Be well, John Spartan"

1022
01:13:07,617 --> 01:13:08,869
Lights.

1023
01:13:26,638 --> 01:13:29,516
"Oh, he doesn't know how
to use the three seashells."

1024
01:13:36,357 --> 01:13:38,026
Happy Halloween.

1025
01:14:09,518 --> 01:14:11,603
"Behavioral engineering"?

1026
01:14:12,729 --> 01:14:16,526
"Hi, Martin, you know, I was thinking....
Oh, my God, I'm sorry, wrong number."

1027
01:14:29,414 --> 01:14:32,459
"Our noble facility has been desecrated
by hooligans."

1028
01:14:33,377 --> 01:14:35,754
"Someone will pay dearly for this."

1029
01:14:39,426 --> 01:14:42,887
"Sir, the stress breeder
is inside being demobilized."

1030
01:14:44,389 --> 01:14:47,517
"Shit! Being frozen must've thrown
my aim off. Don't worry."

1031
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:49,102
"The next shot..."

1032
01:14:49,269 --> 01:14:50,896
"I don't think so."

1033
01:14:51,564 --> 01:14:53,732
"No kiss-kiss, no bang-bang."

1034
01:15:05,587 --> 01:15:06,687
Detective.

1035
01:15:06,788 --> 01:15:08,957
Listen, I'm sorry about last night.

1036
01:15:10,917 --> 01:15:12,419
Here, I made this for you.

1037
01:15:16,299 --> 01:15:17,258
For me?

1038
01:15:17,959 --> 01:15:18,959
Yeah.

1039
01:15:19,969 --> 01:15:21,304
Thank you.

1040
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:25,808
Oh, I'll drive.

1041
01:15:26,267 --> 01:15:28,645
I gotta learn to do this once in my life.

1042
01:15:28,646 --> 01:15:29,646
Okay.

1043
01:15:42,494 --> 01:15:44,329
Thank you for the lovely gift.

1044
01:15:45,288 --> 01:15:50,001
Look, I don't know what you guys put in my cryo-slush,
but when I thawed out, the first thing I wanted to do was knit.

1045
01:15:50,502 --> 01:15:55,165
I mean, how come I know what a zipperfoot,
a shuttle and a hook and bobbin, a petitpoint is?

1046
01:15:55,508 --> 01:15:58,427
I could weave a throw rug now
with my eyes closed.

1047
01:15:58,803 --> 01:16:00,888
It's part of your rehab program.

1048
01:16:00,971 --> 01:16:03,766
For each inmate the computer
draws up a skill or trade...

1049
01:16:03,849 --> 01:16:05,769
...which best suits to their genetic disposition.

1050
01:16:05,852 --> 01:16:07,562
It implants the knowledge...

1051
01:16:07,646 --> 01:16:10,732
...and the desire to carry out
whatever the training was assigned.

1052
01:16:12,359 --> 01:16:13,860
I'm a seamstress?

1053
01:16:14,319 --> 01:16:15,654
Oh, that's just great.

1054
01:16:15,821 --> 01:16:18,449
I come out of cryo-prison
and I'm Betsy-fucking-Ross.

1055
01:16:18,533 --> 01:16:20,993
and Phoenix comes out, he can access computers,
operate all vehicles...

1056
01:16:21,077 --> 01:16:23,454
...knows the location
of every damn thing in town...

1057
01:16:23,538 --> 01:16:26,165
...and is three times stronger than he went in?

1058
01:16:28,710 --> 01:16:31,213
- Can you get me Phoenix's rehab program now?
- Sure.

1059
01:16:33,841 --> 01:16:36,760
- I'm a seamstress.
- Access code for Simon Phoenix.

1060
01:16:37,177 --> 01:16:38,846
"Access Simon Phoenix."

1061
01:16:39,388 --> 01:16:40,681
"Accessing..."

1062
01:16:41,416 --> 01:16:43,268
"Access denied!"

1063
01:16:44,185 --> 01:16:45,770
- What?
"Security override"

1064
01:16:45,854 --> 01:16:47,397
This can't be right.

1065
01:16:51,234 --> 01:16:53,612
"Access granted, Officer Huxley."

1066
01:16:54,655 --> 01:16:57,741
"Accessing Simon Phoenix,
Deepfile Rehab 65-R."

1067
01:16:58,576 --> 01:16:59,785
"Urban Combatkill."

1068
01:16:59,869 --> 01:17:02,246
"Torture Methodology.
Computer Override Authority."

1069
01:17:02,329 --> 01:17:04,290
"Survival Tactics"
- There must be a mistake.

1070
01:17:04,373 --> 01:17:07,752
"Terrorism Tactics. Weapons Training.
Martial Arts. MurderDeathKill."

1071
01:17:07,836 --> 01:17:10,005
"Explosives Technician. Violent Behavior."

1072
01:17:10,088 --> 01:17:12,966
- This isn't a proper rehabilitation program.
- No kidding.

1073
01:17:13,258 --> 01:17:15,135
This would create a monster.

1074
01:17:15,218 --> 01:17:16,845
Who develops these programs?

1075
01:17:16,928 --> 01:17:18,598
Well, Cocteau Industries, of course.

1076
01:17:19,390 --> 01:17:21,142
But why would the benevolent...

1077
01:17:21,225 --> 01:17:24,312
...Dr. Cocteau send such
a brute savage into our midst?

1078
01:17:24,395 --> 01:17:26,314
Well, that's a good question. Why don't we go ask him?

1079
01:17:26,397 --> 01:17:30,109
No, John Spartan. You do not accuse the
savior of our city of being connected with a...

1080
01:17:30,276 --> 01:17:32,946
...multi-MurderDeathKiller like Simon Phoenix. It's...

1081
01:17:33,781 --> 01:17:35,073
...rude.

1082
01:17:35,407 --> 01:17:36,784
I'll be subtle.

1083
01:17:38,118 --> 01:17:39,620
I'm good at subtle.

1084
01:17:41,789 --> 01:17:43,291
"Mellow greetings"

1085
01:17:43,458 --> 01:17:44,959
"We are happy to welcome you..."

1086
01:17:45,084 --> 01:17:48,046
"...to the Cocteau Behavioral
Engineering Complex"

1087
01:17:48,129 --> 01:17:49,255
"Be well"

1088
01:17:49,422 --> 01:17:51,466
Enhance your calm, John Spartan.

1089
01:17:56,764 --> 01:18:00,392
"Mellow apologies for my lack
of physical disposition, detective..."

1090
01:18:00,768 --> 01:18:02,686
"...but I do have an entire city-gov to run."

1091
01:18:02,770 --> 01:18:04,355
Well, run this.

1092
01:18:04,605 --> 01:18:08,026
You programmed Phoenix's rehab
to turn him into a terrorist.

1093
01:18:08,110 --> 01:18:10,695
And I don't think his escape
was an accident, either.

1094
01:18:10,779 --> 01:18:12,288
- Very subtle.
- Thank you.

1095
01:18:12,572 --> 01:18:14,783
Outside the museum,
why didn't he blow your brains out?

1096
01:18:14,866 --> 01:18:16,243
What did you say to him?

1097
01:18:16,326 --> 01:18:18,662
"I honestly don't remember. Does it matter?"

1098
01:18:18,829 --> 01:18:21,082
Yeah, it matters. I saw the security disk.

1099
01:18:21,165 --> 01:18:24,961
He had a full 10 seconds to figure out
where to put the hole in your fucking head.

1100
01:18:25,169 --> 01:18:29,590
"John Spartan, this display of barbaric behavior
was unacceptable even in your time."

1101
01:18:32,010 --> 01:18:33,554
But it worked.

1102
01:18:38,084 --> 01:18:43,272
When a man like Phoenix has a gun to your head,
10 seconds is 9 and a half seconds longer than you get.

1103
01:18:44,189 --> 01:18:45,733
"Not everyone is as eager as you..."

1104
01:18:45,817 --> 01:18:49,320
"...to resort to violence
to solve all the difficulties in life."

1105
01:18:50,064 --> 01:18:55,743
"Even now, I begin to wonder if the chaos in the museum
was the result of Mr. Phoenix's presence or your own?"

1106
01:18:56,661 --> 01:18:58,122
Wonder about this...

1107
01:18:58,205 --> 01:18:59,415
...shithead.

1108
01:18:59,498 --> 01:19:03,043
If you think you got this maniac
under control, trust me...

1109
01:19:03,210 --> 01:19:04,545
...you don't.

1110
01:19:04,737 --> 01:19:08,641
Is there something specific you plan
to do with that archaic device?

1111
01:19:08,842 --> 01:19:09,842
John Spartan.

1112
01:19:12,345 --> 01:19:14,014
No, I didn't think so.

1113
01:19:15,157 --> 01:19:19,186
Detective, the only thing I haven't got
under control is you.

1114
01:19:19,352 --> 01:19:21,355
But that can be solved.

1115
01:19:21,522 --> 01:19:25,067
You, my Cro-Magnon friend, are dead.
Your family's dead...

1116
01:19:25,234 --> 01:19:26,819
...your past is dead.

1117
01:19:27,236 --> 01:19:30,031
Dead things cannot affect the living. So...

1118
01:19:30,364 --> 01:19:31,991
...enjoy your moment...

1119
01:19:32,074 --> 01:19:36,038
...of prehistoric bravado because
after you leave here it will be over.

1120
01:19:36,121 --> 01:19:38,540
Like everything else in your life.

1121
01:19:38,749 --> 01:19:42,211
Officer, return this man
to cryo-stasis immediately.

1122
01:19:42,753 --> 01:19:44,046
Be well.

1123
01:19:45,422 --> 01:19:46,800
Be fucked.

1124
01:19:47,592 --> 01:19:49,552
"You are fined one credit--"

1125
01:19:54,724 --> 01:19:57,894
Greetings, Citizen.
How are you on this glorious day?

1126
01:19:58,854 --> 01:20:00,189
I'll wait here.

1127
01:20:00,314 --> 01:20:01,273
Let's go.

1128
01:20:01,357 --> 01:20:03,984
- Oh, I don't know.
- Look, I do know. Now, turn that thing on.

1129
01:20:04,068 --> 01:20:06,237
I hope you know what you're doing.

1130
01:20:07,238 --> 01:20:09,740
But you're asking me to disobey a direct order.

1131
01:20:09,824 --> 01:20:11,827
I'm to escort you to the cryo-prison.

1132
01:20:11,910 --> 01:20:15,914
Look, you do what you gotta do, I know what I gotta do.
I gotta nail that maniac and put him on ice or that's where I'm gonna be.

1133
01:20:16,123 --> 01:20:18,917
- Enhance your calm, John Spartan.
- Look, I've had it with enhancing my calm.

1134
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:23,589
I'm gonna find that psycho Phoenix and enhance his calm.
And when I'm done, I'm gonna turn all my attention to that Cocteau.

1135
01:20:25,133 --> 01:20:27,927
Now, you don't have to come with me.
I can do this alone, okay?

1136
01:20:28,010 --> 01:20:32,448
Even if Simon Phoenix was programmed to
escape, extinguish life and steal contraband weapons...

1137
01:20:32,473 --> 01:20:34,392
...why are you proceeding into the depths of wasteland?

1138
01:20:34,475 --> 01:20:38,647
The reason your city-wide manhunt didn't work
was because Phoenix was in the one place...

1139
01:20:38,814 --> 01:20:40,399
...a) you can't monitor...

1140
01:20:40,482 --> 01:20:43,485
...b) are afraid to go and c) don't give a shit about.

1141
01:20:44,153 --> 01:20:48,283
Now, I want to go down there, I want to find Phoenix
and I'm gonna put him in a hurt locker.

1142
01:20:49,059 --> 01:20:52,462
So, you want to come with me? Or you want to arrest me, huh?

1143
01:20:53,463 --> 01:20:54,463
Okay.

1144
01:20:54,831 --> 01:20:56,166
I'm with you.

1145
01:20:56,791 --> 01:20:58,501
Let's go blow this guy.

1146
01:21:00,963 --> 01:21:01,964
Away.

1147
01:21:02,131 --> 01:21:03,924
Blow this guy away.

1148
01:21:05,009 --> 01:21:06,135
Whatever.

1149
01:21:12,342 --> 01:21:14,094
She's got a way with words.

1150
01:21:14,395 --> 01:21:15,395
Ugh!

1151
01:21:19,858 --> 01:21:20,858
Ugh!

1152
01:21:20,859 --> 01:21:21,943
What's wrong, Huxley?

1153
01:21:22,027 --> 01:21:23,820
It's not very clean.

1154
01:21:28,493 --> 01:21:30,203
A real garden spot.

1155
01:21:30,828 --> 01:21:32,371
All right, which way Garcia?

1156
01:21:32,663 --> 01:21:33,831
Over there.

1157
01:21:34,040 --> 01:21:36,167
All right, guys, be ready for anything.

1158
01:21:44,343 --> 01:21:46,678
"My dog's better than your dog"

1159
01:21:46,845 --> 01:21:49,014
"My dog's better than yours"

1160
01:21:49,223 --> 01:21:52,352
"My dog's better 'cause
he gets Kennel-Ration. My dog's..."

1161
01:21:53,061 --> 01:21:55,522
I'm sorry, when I'm nervous, I....

1162
01:21:56,022 --> 01:21:57,023
Sorry.

1163
01:21:57,732 --> 01:21:59,108
Over here.

1164
01:22:18,047 --> 01:22:20,047
-Ooh!
-Eew!

1165
01:22:20,048 --> 01:22:21,967
Oh, what's that emanation?

1166
01:22:22,368 --> 01:22:23,168
Oh, yeah.

1167
01:22:24,463 --> 01:22:25,663
Oh, yeah!

1168
01:22:26,764 --> 01:22:28,057
Come on, guys.

1169
01:22:35,699 --> 01:22:39,403
No, hey, just relax.
All I want is a burger and a beer, if you got one.

1170
01:22:41,613 --> 01:22:42,948
How am I gonna pay?

1171
01:22:44,041 --> 01:22:46,410
- Huxley, it's better to give.
- Ow!

1172
01:22:52,060 --> 01:22:53,460
Ah!

1173
01:22:54,461 --> 01:22:55,628
You wanna a slug?

1174
01:22:58,756 --> 01:23:00,091
Oh, no, thank you.

1175
01:23:00,300 --> 01:23:02,135
I think I'm gonna be sick.

1176
01:23:02,427 --> 01:23:03,721
Oh, God.

1177
01:23:04,138 --> 01:23:06,682
This is fantastic. You guys gotta try one.

1178
01:23:06,974 --> 01:23:09,477
Just don't ask where the meat comes from.

1179
01:23:09,643 --> 01:23:11,061
Huxley, what's that supposed to mean?

1180
01:23:11,145 --> 01:23:13,230
Do you see any cows around here, detective?

1181
01:23:21,948 --> 01:23:22,949
Rat?

1182
01:23:24,659 --> 01:23:26,244
This is a rat burger?

1183
01:23:31,292 --> 01:23:32,502
Not bad.

1184
01:23:33,961 --> 01:23:36,380
As a matter of fact, it's the best burger I've had in years.

1185
01:23:39,133 --> 01:23:40,469
See you later.

1186
01:24:03,660 --> 01:24:06,497
They don't seem very hostile,
John Spartan.

1187
01:24:07,665 --> 01:24:08,999
No, they don't.

1188
01:24:18,385 --> 01:24:20,679
Now that's a thing of beauty.

1189
01:24:22,681 --> 01:24:24,307
Huxley, do you know what this is?

1190
01:24:24,391 --> 01:24:28,209
A 1970 Oldsmobile 442.

1191
01:24:29,354 --> 01:24:32,249
With a 455-cubic-inch engine.

1192
01:24:33,025 --> 01:24:35,661
Radial tires and bucket seats.

1193
01:24:36,737 --> 01:24:38,072
I'm impressed.

1194
01:24:38,322 --> 01:24:39,448
I studied.

1195
01:24:39,532 --> 01:24:42,035
So did I. Hand over the glow-rod.

1196
01:24:42,202 --> 01:24:44,371
Your friends, too. Come on, move!

1197
01:24:44,672 --> 01:24:45,372
Ow!

1198
01:24:49,073 --> 01:24:50,673
Ow!

1199
01:24:52,388 --> 01:24:55,008
You got ball-balls cop, coming down here after the show you put on.

1200
01:24:55,717 --> 01:24:57,844
We're looking for a MurderDeathKiller.

1201
01:24:57,927 --> 01:25:01,431
Can you help us or just bully us
with your primitive weapons?

1202
01:25:06,269 --> 01:25:08,314
Well, maybe they're not so primitive.

1203
01:25:11,066 --> 01:25:12,693
So, you think you're taking me in, huh?

1204
01:25:12,776 --> 01:25:13,861
Guess what?

1205
01:25:13,944 --> 01:25:15,196
Not happening.

1206
01:25:15,204 --> 01:25:18,449
You tell Cocteau he can kiss my ass.
Yeah, that's right.

1207
01:25:18,782 --> 01:25:21,161
You tell Cocteau, it's gonna take
an army of assholes to get rid of me...

1208
01:25:21,244 --> 01:25:23,538
...'cause I don't give a shit. I got nothing to lose.

1209
01:25:23,622 --> 01:25:28,126
I don't wanna rain on your parade, pal, but I don't know
who the hell you are, let alone want to take you anywhere.

1210
01:25:28,627 --> 01:25:31,797
So stay here, be well
and Cocteau's an asshole!

1211
01:25:32,924 --> 01:25:36,260
Let's take them and dump them up top.
They're only down here to spy on us.

1212
01:25:37,428 --> 01:25:38,679
Wait a minute.

1213
01:25:40,431 --> 01:25:42,642
You're the guy outside Pizza Hut.

1214
01:25:42,643 --> 01:25:43,643
Yeah.

1215
01:25:44,394 --> 01:25:45,813
What do you want?

1216
01:25:46,313 --> 01:25:48,774
I guess, you weren't part of the Cocteau plan.

1217
01:25:48,941 --> 01:25:52,236
Greed, deception, abuse of power.
That's no plan.

1218
01:25:54,780 --> 01:25:57,158
- That's why everybody's down here?
- You got that right.

1219
01:25:57,325 --> 01:25:58,326
See....

1220
01:25:58,785 --> 01:26:00,787
...according to Cocteau's plan...

1221
01:26:00,954 --> 01:26:03,456
...I'm an enemy because I like to think.

1222
01:26:03,790 --> 01:26:04,916
I like to read.

1223
01:26:04,999 --> 01:26:06,876
I'm into freedom of speech and freedom of choice.

1224
01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:08,587
I'm the kind of guy who likes to sit in a greasy spoon...

1225
01:26:08,671 --> 01:26:12,967
...and wonder, "Gee, should I have the T-Bone steak or
the jumbo rack of barbecued ribs with a side order of gravy fries?"

1226
01:26:13,175 --> 01:26:14,552
I want high cholesterol.

1227
01:26:14,635 --> 01:26:17,138
I want to eat bacon, and butter and buckets of cheese, okay?

1228
01:26:17,304 --> 01:26:20,057
I want to smoke a Cuban cigar
the size of Cincinnati in the non-smoking section.

1229
01:26:20,141 --> 01:26:23,061
I want to run through the streets
naked with green Jell-o all over my body...

1230
01:26:23,311 --> 01:26:26,523
...reading Playboy magazine. Why?
Because I suddenly might feel the need to, okay pal?

1231
01:26:26,690 --> 01:26:28,233
I've seen the future. You know what it is?

1232
01:26:28,316 --> 01:26:30,152
It's a 47-year-old virgin sitting around his beige pijamas...

1233
01:26:30,235 --> 01:26:33,281
...drinking a banana-broccoli shake
and singing "I'm an Oscar Meyer Wiener".

1234
01:26:33,364 --> 01:26:34,907
Live up top, you live Cocteau's way.

1235
01:26:34,991 --> 01:26:37,160
What he wants, when he wants,
how he wants.

1236
01:26:37,243 --> 01:26:39,495
Your other choice: Come down here.

1237
01:26:40,788 --> 01:26:42,373
Maybe starve to death.

1238
01:26:43,166 --> 01:26:46,461
All right, why don't you take charge
and lead these people out of here?

1239
01:26:46,545 --> 01:26:47,754
I'm no leader.

1240
01:26:47,963 --> 01:26:49,798
I do what I have to do.

1241
01:26:49,923 --> 01:26:51,508
Sometimes people come with me.

1242
01:26:51,592 --> 01:26:56,221
All I want to do is bury Cocteau up to his neck
in shit and let him think happy-happy thoughts forever.

1243
01:26:56,597 --> 01:26:58,433
Then I got bad news.

1244
01:26:59,184 --> 01:27:01,394
I think he wants to kill you.

1245
01:27:04,189 --> 01:27:06,649
All right gentlemen, let's review.

1246
01:27:07,442 --> 01:27:08,818
The year is 2032.

1247
01:27:09,652 --> 01:27:12,406
That's 2-0-3-2. As in the 21st century.

1248
01:27:13,741 --> 01:27:18,612
And I'm sorry to say that
the world has become a pussy-whipped...

1249
01:27:18,829 --> 01:27:23,001
...Brady Bunch version of itself,
run by a bunch of robed sissies.

1250
01:27:24,044 --> 01:27:26,838
All we have to do to run the whole thing...

1251
01:27:26,963 --> 01:27:30,884
...is to kill a man named Friendly,
who put it all together.

1252
01:27:32,035 --> 01:27:34,639
Ah, but there's an extra added bonus.

1253
01:27:36,390 --> 01:27:37,892
We get to kill...

1254
01:27:38,059 --> 01:27:40,394
...the man who put most of us behind the freezer.

1255
01:27:40,561 --> 01:27:41,729
You mean...

1256
01:27:41,896 --> 01:27:43,648
...we get to kill John Spartan?

1257
01:27:43,731 --> 01:27:44,899
Exactly.

1258
01:27:45,233 --> 01:27:48,487
I want you to loot, pillage,
plunder, I want you to steal.

1259
01:27:48,821 --> 01:27:53,283
I want you to do all the wonderful things
that we used to do before any of this happened.

1260
01:27:54,034 --> 01:27:56,078
This world will be ours!

1261
01:27:56,286 --> 01:27:58,121
Let's bring back the good old days!

1262
01:27:58,205 --> 01:27:59,582
Are you with me?

1263
01:27:59,991 --> 01:28:02,418
Are you with me? Let's do it!

1264
01:28:05,255 --> 01:28:09,384
It is a curious conclusion
which you have deduced, John Spartan.

1265
01:28:10,260 --> 01:28:13,013
But I can find no fault in your logic.

1266
01:28:13,138 --> 01:28:17,268
Simon Phoenix is the perfect weapon to send
out into the savage outer regions in which we stand.

1267
01:28:17,977 --> 01:28:19,937
I'm impressed, John Spartan.

1268
01:28:20,146 --> 01:28:22,773
You mean they thawed this guy out just to kill me?

1269
01:28:23,858 --> 01:28:26,987
- I'm flattered.
- Don't be flattered. Be frightened.

1270
01:28:27,237 --> 01:28:29,447
This guy's a certifiable nightmare.

1271
01:28:29,614 --> 01:28:31,616
- And that's why you're down here?
- Yeah.

1272
01:28:33,994 --> 01:28:37,582
I must have done something right
in the previous life.

1273
01:28:38,082 --> 01:28:40,585
Can't imagine what that could have been.

1274
01:28:42,545 --> 01:28:44,255
Two for the price of one.

1275
01:28:44,505 --> 01:28:46,174
Let's take them boys.

1276
01:28:51,138 --> 01:28:52,472
Stay down!

1277
01:29:25,591 --> 01:29:28,512
I'll be goddamned.
Like a New York cockroach.

1278
01:29:58,252 --> 01:29:59,962
Everything's gone wrong.

1279
01:30:06,663 --> 01:30:07,863
Phoenix!

1280
01:30:16,480 --> 01:30:18,941
There's an elevator shaft on top of this place.

1281
01:30:21,235 --> 01:30:22,778
Does that mean we're going up?

1282
01:30:22,945 --> 01:30:25,531
Momentito, Senorita Huxley. Come on.

1283
01:30:44,177 --> 01:30:46,888
How nice! Must've been expecting me.

1284
01:31:03,822 --> 01:31:05,074
Okay, now what?

1285
01:31:05,158 --> 01:31:06,534
Buckle up.

1286
01:31:29,976 --> 01:31:31,937
There he is! He's in my car!

1287
01:31:37,984 --> 01:31:39,402
Goddamn it.

1288
01:31:45,993 --> 01:31:48,162
What's happening to cops today?

1289
01:31:48,246 --> 01:31:50,873
Don't you know you are
endangering the lives of civilians?

1290
01:32:09,519 --> 01:32:10,395
Auto-inflate!

1291
01:32:10,478 --> 01:32:11,813
"Auto-inflate"

1292
01:32:13,814 --> 01:32:14,814
Damn!

1293
01:32:17,360 --> 01:32:18,487
Oh, that's just lovely.

1294
01:32:18,571 --> 01:32:20,072
Huxley, drive!

1295
01:32:20,214 --> 01:32:22,992
Okay, okay. I've read all about this, now... okay.

1296
01:32:25,578 --> 01:32:27,872
What do I do? I just, I just push this pedal?

1297
01:32:28,873 --> 01:32:29,873
Whoa!

1298
01:32:30,291 --> 01:32:31,877
Okay, okay. I got it, I got it.

1299
01:32:41,428 --> 01:32:42,762
Punch it, Huxley!

1300
01:32:43,014 --> 01:32:44,098
Excuse me?

1301
01:32:44,223 --> 01:32:46,726
Push the pedal as hard as you can!
Just catch up to him.

1302
01:32:56,321 --> 01:32:57,321
Shit!

1303
01:32:58,022 --> 01:32:59,373
No free rides!

1304
01:33:05,120 --> 01:33:06,705
Emergency, doors open.

1305
01:33:06,788 --> 01:33:08,041
"Doors opening"

1306
01:33:09,334 --> 01:33:11,044
Say hello to my old friend.

1307
01:33:23,307 --> 01:33:24,391
Doors close!

1308
01:33:24,475 --> 01:33:25,643
"Malfunction"

1309
01:33:31,273 --> 01:33:33,151
Computer, auto-drive.

1310
01:33:33,401 --> 01:33:35,111
"Auto-drive engaged"

1311
01:33:35,278 --> 01:33:37,197
Going to give you a haircut!

1312
01:33:38,698 --> 01:33:40,867
Remember those 40 bus passengers...

1313
01:33:40,951 --> 01:33:43,370
...that you blew apart trying to catch me?

1314
01:33:44,747 --> 01:33:46,749
They were already dead.

1315
01:33:47,208 --> 01:33:49,043
Cold as Haagen-Dazs!

1316
01:33:57,135 --> 01:33:59,763
Man, I went to jail with a 36-year smile.

1317
01:34:00,973 --> 01:34:02,432
You're dead, Spartan.

1318
01:34:02,641 --> 01:34:04,434
Speak for yourself.

1319
01:34:13,653 --> 01:34:14,612
Self-drive!

1320
01:34:14,696 --> 01:34:16,447
"Unable to execute"

1321
01:34:16,739 --> 01:34:18,408
- Self-drive, now!
"Malfunction"

1322
01:34:18,491 --> 01:34:20,243
"Unable to execute"

1323
01:34:20,493 --> 01:34:21,662
Emergency!

1324
01:34:23,706 --> 01:34:24,832
Brake!

1325
01:34:26,166 --> 01:34:27,668
"Self-drive engaged"

1326
01:34:29,295 --> 01:34:30,838
Brake! Brake!

1327
01:34:33,174 --> 01:34:36,136
Brake now, you
Mickey Mouse piece of shit!

1328
01:35:08,880 --> 01:35:09,880
John Spartan?

1329
01:35:10,881 --> 01:35:12,592
John Spartan, are you in there?

1330
01:35:13,218 --> 01:35:14,218
John Spartan?

1331
01:35:14,219 --> 01:35:16,387
Who do you think it is, Huxley?

1332
01:35:24,605 --> 01:35:27,733
I thought your life force
had been prematurely terminated!

1333
01:35:27,816 --> 01:35:30,069
Yeah, I thought I was history too.

1334
01:35:30,236 --> 01:35:33,989
What the hell happened? All the sudden,
this car turned into a cannoli.

1335
01:35:34,240 --> 01:35:37,035
It's secur-a-foam. It saved your life.

1336
01:35:37,244 --> 01:35:39,579
Look at you, you're in shambles.

1337
01:35:39,871 --> 01:35:43,250
Don't worry, I can fix it later.
All I need is a needle and thread.

1338
01:35:43,583 --> 01:35:45,502
I really didn't say that, did I?

1339
01:35:45,603 --> 01:35:46,703
Damn!

1340
01:35:53,429 --> 01:35:57,932
John Spartan, you... You caveman, you're under arrest!

1341
01:35:58,516 --> 01:36:01,103
You're to be returned to the cryo-prison.
Immediately!

1342
01:36:01,186 --> 01:36:03,897
I heard all about that. We'll talk later, Chief.

1343
01:36:04,448 --> 01:36:06,926
Right now, I need something, anything. A shotgun, a flare gun.

1344
01:36:06,927 --> 01:36:08,027
- Spartan.
- What?

1345
01:36:11,613 --> 01:36:12,489
Shit!

1346
01:36:12,657 --> 01:36:14,158
Defensive red alert!

1347
01:36:15,869 --> 01:36:17,287
Stun batons on.

1348
01:36:18,621 --> 01:36:19,831
Relax.

1349
01:36:20,790 --> 01:36:22,625
Well, look at you, you get a bump on the noggin...

1350
01:36:22,709 --> 01:36:24,878
...and you think you're Pancho Villa?

1351
01:36:25,379 --> 01:36:26,338
Who?

1352
01:36:26,839 --> 01:36:27,715
Never mind.

1353
01:36:27,798 --> 01:36:29,341
Time to take a stand, pal.

1354
01:36:29,425 --> 01:36:33,053
Well, good. While you're doing it,
loan me a gun. Loan me two guns.

1355
01:36:33,304 --> 01:36:37,225
You'd use these weapons of mass destruction
against men and women who uphold the law?

1356
01:36:37,434 --> 01:36:40,312
We use these weapons
to shop for groceries, dick.

1357
01:36:40,479 --> 01:36:42,479
Spartan, wait!

1358
01:36:42,480 --> 01:36:43,857
You can't leave.

1359
01:36:44,065 --> 01:36:48,778
You're under arrest. This very concept
negates the possibility of your leaving.

1360
01:36:48,987 --> 01:36:50,573
Skip it, Chief.

1361
01:36:51,032 --> 01:36:52,783
Lieutenant Huxley!

1362
01:36:53,117 --> 01:36:54,160
Chief...

1363
01:36:54,243 --> 01:36:57,613
...you can take this job
and you can shovel it. Hmm?

1364
01:36:59,957 --> 01:37:01,626
"Take this job...

1365
01:37:01,834 --> 01:37:03,678
"...and shovel it."
- Yeah?

1366
01:37:05,005 --> 01:37:06,506
Close enough.

1367
01:37:11,929 --> 01:37:16,267
I hadn't counted on this but I must say,
you worked out beautifully.

1368
01:37:17,352 --> 01:37:19,270
People are terrified of you.

1369
01:37:19,604 --> 01:37:22,440
What's new? People have always been
terrified of me.

1370
01:37:22,524 --> 01:37:25,401
Yes, but this time they're really intimidated.

1371
01:37:27,655 --> 01:37:28,864
Now...

1372
01:37:29,156 --> 01:37:32,910
...I'll have carte blanche
to create the perfect society.

1373
01:37:34,578 --> 01:37:35,996
My society.

1374
01:37:36,914 --> 01:37:39,793
San Angeles will be a beacon of order...

1375
01:37:40,585 --> 01:37:43,213
...with the purity of an ant colony.

1376
01:37:44,047 --> 01:37:46,633
And the beauty of a flawless pearl.

1377
01:37:47,067 --> 01:37:49,636
Look, you can't take away people's right to be assholes.

1378
01:37:52,098 --> 01:37:53,599
That's who you remind me of...

1379
01:37:54,350 --> 01:37:55,977
...an evil Mr. Rogers.

1380
01:37:56,185 --> 01:37:57,770
Will you please kill him?

1381
01:37:57,853 --> 01:37:59,397
He's pissing me off.

1382
01:38:10,075 --> 01:38:12,244
Put another log on the fire!

1383
01:38:13,829 --> 01:38:15,957
I'll love running this place!

1384
01:38:23,214 --> 01:38:24,674
Well, now...

1385
01:38:24,966 --> 01:38:28,018
...what shall I do with you. Huh, Bobby?

1386
01:38:28,929 --> 01:38:31,432
I am an excellent associate, sir.

1387
01:38:32,016 --> 01:38:35,978
I'd be delighted to continue my services
during your administration.

1388
01:38:36,346 --> 01:38:38,480
Huh, Danzig, maybe we'll use him--

1389
01:38:38,564 --> 01:38:40,609
Excuse me, the police are here.

1390
01:38:41,860 --> 01:38:43,153
Oh, man!

1391
01:39:09,181 --> 01:39:11,266
Where the fuck do you think... Ow!

1392
01:39:29,369 --> 01:39:30,746
I'm impressed.

1393
01:39:44,302 --> 01:39:46,638
That man has died by my hands.

1394
01:39:47,347 --> 01:39:49,057
It was either him or us, Huxley.

1395
01:39:50,517 --> 01:39:52,018
Yeah, there is that.

1396
01:39:52,227 --> 01:39:54,479
Anyway, where the hell did you learn to kick like that?

1397
01:39:55,731 --> 01:39:57,525
Jackie Chan movies.

1398
01:40:05,992 --> 01:40:08,954
Looks like the Cocteau plan
just went up in smoke.

1399
01:40:09,413 --> 01:40:11,790
Rest in peace, Raymond Cocteau.

1400
01:40:12,791 --> 01:40:16,753
Oh, John Spartan, civilization as we know it
will come to an end.

1401
01:40:17,796 --> 01:40:18,922
What will we do?

1402
01:40:19,006 --> 01:40:21,593
I don't know, but trust me, this is better for you.

1403
01:40:21,759 --> 01:40:23,219
What's that?

1404
01:40:28,099 --> 01:40:29,559
Oh, this is bad.

1405
01:40:29,851 --> 01:40:31,102
This is very bad.

1406
01:40:31,185 --> 01:40:35,190
He's accessed the cryo-prison
and is about to defrost the entire multi-lifer wing.

1407
01:40:35,316 --> 01:40:36,817
Most of them don't like you.

1408
01:40:36,984 --> 01:40:40,487
Most of these guys don't even like
their own mothers. They're bad boys, Huxley.

1409
01:40:40,571 --> 01:40:42,031
How many are there?

1410
01:40:45,243 --> 01:40:46,244
Eighty.

1411
01:40:46,536 --> 01:40:47,954
All without rehab.

1412
01:40:48,038 --> 01:40:49,998
They'll be re-animated within the hour.

1413
01:40:50,081 --> 01:40:51,833
Oh, we gotta stop this.

1414
01:40:53,710 --> 01:40:58,132
I'm not at all pleased about having caused
the fatality of that deranged cryo-convict.

1415
01:40:58,382 --> 01:41:02,595
I now understand that under certain
circumstances that violence is necessary.

1416
01:41:02,803 --> 01:41:03,971
Good.

1417
01:41:08,685 --> 01:41:10,854
I hope you understand this.

1418
01:41:19,821 --> 01:41:22,158
I hope my butt didn't look like that.

1419
01:41:22,325 --> 01:41:25,078
Okay, who do we have left that's good, huh?

1420
01:41:25,245 --> 01:41:26,412
Let's see...

1421
01:41:26,538 --> 01:41:28,039
...Foulks, Patrick.

1422
01:41:28,206 --> 01:41:30,708
Jeffrey Dahmer? I love that guy.

1423
01:41:30,793 --> 01:41:33,504
Look, we gotta get him.
How long before the rest are done?

1424
01:41:33,587 --> 01:41:35,589
They're in the final stages of reanimation, sir.

1425
01:41:35,673 --> 01:41:37,508
Great. Absolutely great.

1426
01:41:39,301 --> 01:41:40,427
Gentlemen!

1427
01:41:40,970 --> 01:41:44,431
Thank you very much, but your services
will no longer be required.

1428
01:41:51,523 --> 01:41:53,942
Send a maniac to catch a maniac.

1430
01:42:13,630 --> 01:42:15,007

01:42:34,652 --> 01:42:37,323

1439
01:42:41,827 --> 01:42:43,579
What the hell is that?

1440
01:43:20,160 --> 01:43:22,287
Didn't expect that one, did you?

1441
01:43:22,663 --> 01:43:24,081
Where the fuck you going?

1442
01:43:24,164 --> 01:43:26,084
I wish you the best of luck, sir.

1443
01:43:27,085 --> 01:43:28,086
Stupid.

1444
01:43:35,502 --> 01:43:37,513
Spartan, how's it hanging, huh?

1445
01:43:39,098 --> 01:43:42,226
I'm sure you're familiar
with the long arm of the law.

1446
01:43:47,231 --> 01:43:50,318
Oh, come on Spartan, won't you struggle a little bit?
Make me work for it, huh?

1447
01:43:50,402 --> 01:43:52,279
What do you say? How about...

1448
01:43:52,362 --> 01:43:55,448
...a little target practice. What do you say?

1449
01:44:03,666 --> 01:44:05,376
Oops, didn't hurt your head?

1450
01:44:25,689 --> 01:44:27,275
Shit! Goddamn!

1451
01:44:34,866 --> 01:44:35,783
Fuck!

1452
01:44:47,880 --> 01:44:49,256
That's it, Spartan!

1453
01:44:49,798 --> 01:44:52,010
You're not getting out of this one!

1454
01:44:55,013 --> 01:44:57,641
I could drop you in that vat of defrost, over there...

1455
01:44:57,807 --> 01:44:59,893
...and fry your ass like a chicken...

1456
01:45:01,102 --> 01:45:04,190
...or with my little pinky,
drop your monkey ass down--

1457
01:45:06,817 --> 01:45:08,402
I'll be goddamned.

1458
01:45:49,780 --> 01:45:51,073
Shit! Goddamn!

1459
01:45:51,323 --> 01:45:52,325
What am I doing wrong?

1460
01:45:52,534 --> 01:45:54,369
"Cryo-prisoner re-animation..."

"Is it cold in here, or is it just me?"

1463
01:46:08,301 --> 01:46:09,760
Good memory.

1464
01:46:16,100 --> 01:46:17,394
Come here!

1465
01:46:17,811 --> 01:46:18,979
Shit!

1466
01:46:29,824 --> 01:46:31,284
I hate cops!

1467
01:46:35,622 --> 01:46:38,207
Look into my eyes, John. I'll see you in hell.

1468
01:46:38,625 --> 01:46:39,584
Not.

1469
01:47:22,798 --> 01:47:25,217
This is the best day of my life.

1470
01:47:55,667 --> 01:47:57,002
Heads up!

1471
01:48:47,973 --> 01:48:51,894
You've apprehended the villain responsible
for murdering our beloved Dr. Raymond Cocteau?

1472
01:48:52,102 --> 01:48:53,979
Well, I wouldn't exactly say "apprehend".

1473
01:48:54,146 --> 01:48:55,648
Let's just say he's history.

1474
01:48:55,898 --> 01:48:57,525
And the cryo-prison...

1475
01:48:57,651 --> 01:48:59,110
...that's history, too.

1476
01:49:02,072 --> 01:49:03,615
What'll we do?

1477
01:49:04,574 --> 01:49:05,700
How will we live?

1478
01:49:05,784 --> 01:49:09,538
I'll tell you what we're gonna do. We'll go out drinking,
all of us, get shit-faced and paint the town, literally.

1479
01:49:09,830 --> 01:49:11,741
Put up graffiti, slogans, it'll be a blast.

1480
01:49:11,742 --> 01:49:12,540
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1481
01:49:12,541 --> 01:49:14,001
I'm gonna tell you what you're gonna do.

1482
01:49:14,085 --> 01:49:16,003
Why don't you get a little dirty...

1483
01:49:16,087 --> 01:49:17,838
...you, a lot clean.

1484
01:49:18,047 --> 01:49:20,174
And somewhere in the middle....

1485
01:49:20,967 --> 01:49:22,844
I don't know, you'll figure it out.

1486
01:49:23,178 --> 01:49:24,388
Fucking-A!

1487
01:49:27,557 --> 01:49:28,450
Well put.

1488
01:49:28,451 --> 01:49:30,151
Mister Friendly. Mister Friendly?

1489
01:49:30,435 --> 01:49:32,562
Greetings and salutations, Edgar Friendly.

1490
01:49:32,729 --> 01:49:35,108
I'm Associate Bob. And may I say...

1491
01:49:35,275 --> 01:49:38,695
...it'll be a great pleasure
to assist you creating a more humane--

1492
01:49:38,696 --> 01:49:39,696
Bob, Bob.

1493
01:49:39,946 --> 01:49:41,698
- Let's talk about the hair, okay?
- Hair?

1494
01:49:41,781 --> 01:49:45,493
- Pick a color, right? And lose the kimono. You look like a couch.
- Couch?

1495
01:49:45,618 --> 01:49:48,163
What are you, a surgeon with these gloves?

1496
01:49:52,167 --> 01:49:54,795
Thank you for rendering me unconscious.

1497
01:49:56,797 --> 01:49:58,257
Huxley, I did it for your own good.

1498
01:49:58,340 --> 01:50:00,677
- We're supposed to be a team.
- We are.

1499
01:50:09,644 --> 01:50:10,895
Oh, my.

1500
01:50:11,689 --> 01:50:14,400
Are all fluid transfer activities like this?

1501
01:50:14,525 --> 01:50:16,193
- Better.
- Better?

1502
01:50:17,445 --> 01:50:18,654
Oh, my.

1503
01:50:22,074 --> 01:50:24,077
I think I'll like the future.

1504
01:50:24,244 --> 01:50:26,622
Now that you've demolished everything.

1505
01:50:26,864 --> 01:50:29,499
- But there's just one thing I want to know.
- Hmm?

1506
01:50:29,625 --> 01:50:32,544
How's that damn
three seashell thing work?

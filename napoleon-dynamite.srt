00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:18,779
In here we have
some boondoggle key chains.

156
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:21,615
A must-have for
this season's fashion.

157
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:24,451
I already made, like, infinity
of those at Scout camp.

158
00:12:24,536 --> 00:12:26,578
Well, is anyone else here?

159
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:28,914
I'm trying to earn money
for college.

Come get some dinner.

Eat the food.

00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:08,454
Eat the food!

[Grunting]

169
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:27,890
It'd be nice if you could
pull me into town.

170
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:44,573
My name is Rex,
and if you study
with my eight-week program,

171
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,617
you will learn a system
of self-defense...

172
00:13:46,701 --> 00:13:49,495
that I developed
over two seasons of fighting
in the Octagon.

173
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:52,581
It's called Rex Kwon Do!

174
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:55,542
I need a volunteer.

175
00:13:55,627 --> 00:13:58,003
Okay, you'll do.
Come up here.

176
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:01,882
Bow to your sensei.
Bow to your sensei!

177
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:03,884
Okay.

178
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:07,012
Now, I'm gonna give you
one chance.

179
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:09,765
One chance, people.
Give me your best shot.

180
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:16,355
All right.
That was pretty good. Okay.

181
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:18,398
Now, watch this, everybody.

182
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:20,651
Grab my arm.
The other arm.

183
00:14:20,735 --> 00:14:22,694
My other arm.

184
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:25,531
Now watch this.
I'm just gonna break
the wrist and walk away.

185
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:27,491
Break the wrist, walk away.

186
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:29,701
Geez!
Okay.

187
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:32,538
It's just that simple.
Now, I want you to kick me.

188
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:34,706
Come on. Kick me.

189
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,751
Okay, do it again.

190
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:39,878
Do it again.

191
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:42,881
Ouch.
Okay. You'll block it
every time.

192
00:14:42,966 --> 00:14:45,551
Have a seat.

193
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:47,928
Now, in addition to
what you just saw,

194
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:51,765
if you study with
my eight-week program,
you're gonna learn these things.

195
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:53,809
First off,

196
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,811
Rex Kwon Do,
we use the buddy system.

197
00:14:55,895 --> 00:15:00,399
No more flyin' solo.
You need somebody watching
your back at all times!

198
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:03,735
Second off, you're gonna learn
to discipline your image.

199
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,821
Do you think I got
where I am today...

200
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,656
because I dress like
Peter Pan here?

201
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:11,118
Take a look at what
I'm wearing, people.

202
00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:13,662
Do you think anybody wants
a roundhouse kick to the face...

203
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:16,540
while I'm wearin'
these bad boys?

204
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:19,751
Forget about it.
Last off,

205
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:23,922
my students will learn
about self-respect.

206
00:15:24,007 --> 00:15:28,427
Do you think anybody thinks
I'm a failure because I go home
to Starla at night?

207
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:31,013
Forget about it!

208
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:34,057
Now, for only $300,
you can sign up right now...

209
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:36,393
for my eight-week program.

210
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:46,153
Well, that place
was a rip-off.

211
00:16:04,714 --> 00:16:06,715

So me and you are pretty much
friends by now, right?

234
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:46,148
Yes.

235
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:48,483
So, you got my back
and everything?

236
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:50,026
What?

237

Never mind.
[Chattering]

00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:58,160
- Have you heard
about the dance?
- Yes.

00:17:58,244 --> 00:18:00,662
Have you met anyone to ask yet?

240
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:04,332
No. But I probably will
after school.

Who you gonna ask?

242

- Summer Wheatly? How the heck
are you gonna do that?

Build her a cake
or something.

00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,891
Yeah, my old girlfriend
from Oklahoma...

246
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:22,934
was gonna fly out here
for the dance,

247
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:25,729
but she couldn't
'cause she's doing
some modeling right now.

248
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:28,356
Is she hot?

Wow.

Yeah, I took her to the mall
to get some glamour shots
for her birthday one year.

to grow that mustache?

No.

You see that girl
over there?

261
00:19:44,225 --> 00:19:46,935
She came over to my house
the other day.

262
00:19:47,061 --> 00:19:49,020
Why?
I don't know,

263
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:51,773
but she left all this crap
on my porch.

264
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:55,694
She's pretty good-looking.

265
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:57,863
Do you dare me
to go talk to her?

266
00:19:57,947 --> 00:20:00,156
Sure.

267
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:16,047
I see you're drinking
one-percent. Is that 'cause
you think you're fat?

268
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:21,887
'Cause you're not.
You could be drinking whole
if you wanted to.

Well, I have all
your equipment in my locker.

You should probably come get it
'cause I can't fit my nunchakus
in there anymore.

go back in time.

pretty serious right now.

animals and warriors and stuff?

469
00:35:50,065 --> 00:35:52,274
Yes.

470
00:35:52,359 --> 00:35:54,693
Probably the best
that I know of.

471
00:35:54,778 --> 00:35:57,446
Just draw a picture
of the girl you want to
take out...

472
00:35:57,531 --> 00:36:00,199
and give it to her
for, like, a gift or something.

473
00:36:01,243 --> 00:36:03,577
That's a pretty good idea.

474
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:34,149
Now, if you invest
in the 24-piece set,

475
00:36:34,234 --> 00:36:36,694
I'm gonna throw in
a little gift.

476
00:36:36,778 --> 00:36:39,113
So, what's the gift?

477
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:44,410
I bet you folks
don't have one of these.

478
00:36:49,416 --> 00:36:51,584
I want that.

479
00:36:51,668 --> 00:36:54,712

your run-of-the-mill
"crapper-ware."

480
00:36:54,796 --> 00:36:58,424
These are some serious
"NuPont" fiber-woven bowls.

481
00:36:58,508 --> 00:37:01,552
So, if we purchase
the 24-piece set,

482
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:03,554
the mini sailboat
is included?

483
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:05,764
That's correct, sir.

00:37:05,849 --> 00:37:09,018
Lance, you look like
a strong young pup.

give that a nice tear.

Don't hurt yourself now.

487

in five seconds.

I made, like, 75 bucks today.

you don't have a job.
